In the American dub this is never mentioned. Ren starts off as a 13-year-old in the manga and the original Japanese anime, while in the English anime he first appears as a 15-year-old.\n\nHe is serious, logical, and emotionally aloof. He has become like this because of how he was raised. Because of his father, Ren had adapted a deep hatred towards humanity and a strong yearning to eliminate them all. He also believed that his spirit companion, Bason, was only meant to be used as a tool and to treat him as a friend would only result in the spirit taking advantage over him. Ren's anger and hatred came from his father (or uncle in the English anime), Tao Y\u00faan (Tao En). Forced to train and study at a very young age, Ren had his childhood stolen from him. He hated Tao En for all of his suffering.\n\nAs he gains the friendship of Yoh and the others, he realizes that everything he once believed about the world was not true. He learned to trust others and that humans weren't as awful as he thought they were because Yoh and the others showed him that some people truly are kind. A new will to change himself took over. He wanted to let go of his hatred so he could be able to move on with his life, so he returned to China to defeat his father.\n\nHis first attempt failed, but he refused to give in to his father, even as he remained chained in the dungeon of his home. Thanks to Bason, Yoh and the others came to help him. He thanked them for rescuing him but was persistent in saying that he didn't want any help from them. He said it was his problem alone. But eventually all of them defeated Tao Y\u00faan together; allowing Ren to finally move on.\n\nRen tries hard to maintain a tough and confident exterior and is aloof, but deep down would risk his life for his allies. Ren is a particularly impatient person with a very short temper, and isn't afraid to hurt the source of the anger.\n\nRen is an egotistical person and usually doesn't care that people think that he's overly proud. He even named his own team, \"Team the Ren,\" much to the annoyance of his teammate, Horohoro. His overflowing self-confidence annoys some of the other characters. In addition, Ren is also very intuitive, quick-witted, and sometimes stubborn. He is also very defiant. He rarely listens to what anyone says or takes their instructions. Before and during the process in which he befriended Yoh, he even was bold enough to disobey his father on various occasions.\n\nIt is mentioned that Ren is skilled in more than one area of combat. Not only is he a powerful shaman capable of doing things most shamans his age would not be able to, but in addition, he also seems to be skilled in martial arts and sword fighting, in addition to also learning many of Mikihisa Asakura's techniques simply by experiencing them firsthand. It is also lightly suggested in the manga that Ren can also play the erhu.\n\nAs the series progresses, Ren begins to trust others more. Out of all his friends, his bonds with Yoh and Horohoro seem to be the strongest. Ren often fights with Horohoro and the two do not seem to get along at all. However, after Ren sacrifices himself to save him, it becomes apparent that they really do care for one another. As Faust worked to try to save Ren's life after the incident, Horohoro did his best to protect the unconscious Ren.\n\nRen's name in Chinese means \"benevolent,\" \"tough,\" and \"edge of a knife,\" all of which are reflected in his character. His actual Chinese name, Li\u00e1n, means \"lotus\". In the English dub, he is given a British accent. He also has an obsession with milk and the number 3.\n\nHis Furyoku is 100,001 (as seen in chapter 276)\n\nIn Shaman King Character Book, there was an interview asking what kind of girl he likes and he said he would only like a girl if she's smaller than him and not annoying. This must be the reason why he married Iron Maiden Jeanne and had a son named Men Tao.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":2828,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2828\/Setsuna_Meiou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/255309.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/255309.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/255309t.webp"}},"name":"Setsuna Meiou","name_kanji":"\u51a5\u738b \u305b\u3064\u306a","nicknames":["Guardian of Time","Sailor Pluto","Puu"],"favorites":546,"about":"Birthday: October 29\nZodiac: Scorpio\nBlood type: A\nHobby: shopping\nFavorite color: dark red\nFavorite stone: garnet\nFavorite sport: rhythmic gymnastics\nFavorite class: Physics\nLeast favorite class: Music\nFavorite food: green tea\nLeast favorite food: eggplant\n\nSailor Pluto first appears as a Senshi in the second major story arc, and her civilian form is not shown until the third. She is unique among all the characters in that she is stationed at the Door of Space-Time, with the specific duty of forbidding anyone to pass through it without permission. She has powers that relate to both time and the underworld.\n\nSailor Pluto is not introduced until late in the Sailor Moon R series. She is the soldier who guards the gates of time. She is first seen contacting Chibiusa through Luna-P. Sailor Pluto refers to Chibiusa as \"Small Lady.\" Chibiusa usually calls Sailor Pluto by the nickname \"Puu.\" She acts as Chibiusa's guardian.\n\nAfter the events of the second story arc, she leaves the gates of time to temporarily live as a human being, joins the rest of the Outer Senshi, and becomes a university student studying physics. The exact nature of how she leaves her post differs between versions; in the manga, she is reincarnated in present day by Neo-Queen Serenity after sacrificing herself during the second arc, while in the anime Neo-Queen Serenity allows her to leave. Even in her civilian form, Setsuna is the oldest of the Sailor Team, around her late teens or older.\n\nHer personality has been described as distant and somewhat lonely, however she does consistently display warmth and affection toward Chibiusa. When she reincarnates, she becomes more friendly, but is still not very emotional, although there are moments in the manga where she expresses much more emotion than the anime. She later cares for Hotaru along with Michiru and Haruka.\n\nUnlike the other Senshi, it is questioned whether she is fully human\u2014she has been described as \"a goddess, eternally guarding the Portal of Space and Time.\"\n\nSailor Pluto's precise abilities and knowledge of the past and present are only vaguely defined, although a common theory is a form of omniscience, possibly due to her portrayal in the anime. For example, she was presumably aware of the two sailor soldiers carrying the mystical objects they were hunting for, but did not inform them and allowed various people to be attacked. (This differs greatly from the manga, and may be a simple continuity error.) This omniscience is represented as being able to watch through the gates of time, and such.\n\nSailor Pluto appears in just a few TV episodes. Unlike Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus, she is sympathetic toward the Guardian Senshi, and assists them on several occasions. During the second story arc, she allows them to travel through time even though this is not ordinarily allowed. In the third story arc, she often extends help or advice to Sailor Moon and her companions even when Sailors Uranus and Neptune want the two groups separate. Later, Setsuna joins the Guardian Senshi in investigating the true identity of ChibiChibi. In the manga, she is an inspiration to Ami, and her relationship with Ami gives Sailor Mercury additional strength to power-up to her Super form.\n\nSailor Pluto has additional, less cited influences and spheres of dominion in her manga incarnation, influences that are vaguely suggested in the anime, but never made explicit. Sailor Pluto is much darker in her initial form in the manga, identified as the \"Guardian of the Underworld\" with very dark skin and a black sailor uniform. She is also stated to be the daughter of Chronos, god of time. She is a ruthless soldier who follows rather exacting laws, executing any intruders who dare violate the underworld in search for the Gates of Time. She nearly kills Sailor Moon before realizing who she is, stating that \"all who break the taboo must be eliminated.\" Luna also states to the others that no one is to even know that she (Sailor Pluto) exists, due to her dominion and nature, and that to her knowledge no one has ever seen her. Luna calls her a \"lone warrior,\" noting the sadness in her eyes."},{"mal_id":2868,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2868\/Tamahome","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/89905.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/89905.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/89905t.webp"}},"name":"Tamahome","name_kanji":"\u9b3c\u5bbf","nicknames":["Kishuku Sou","\u742e \u9b3c\u5bbf","Tama","Taka","Xong Gui Siu"],"favorites":545,"about":"Quick Facts\n\n- He is 17 years old at the beginning of the story\n- His qualities include: hard working, greedy, caring, strong, compassionate, loyal, funny, determined, courageous.\n- His two most favorite things are money and Miaka. \n- He is one of the seven star warriors of Suzaku and bears the sign \u2018oni\u2019 on his forehead.

When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his ki to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.\n\nInitially, the story portrays Tamahome as a greedy young man, interested in helping others only if it means getting paid for it later. It is eventually revealed that his interest in accumulating money derives from trying to support his family. He comes across as cheerful, vain, and comic, but is actually shy and emotionally strong. Throughout the series, he demonstrates himself to be a sincere young man who is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others and unwilling to back down from enemies.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":33118,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/33118\/Ferris_Eris","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/100444.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/100444.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/100444t.webp"}},"name":"Ferris Eris","name_kanji":"\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30a8\u30ea\u30b9","nicknames":[],"favorites":545,"about":"Ferris, who comes from a famous clan of swordsmen designated to serve as guards to the King of Roland, is the heroine of the story.

As the guardian of the Temple of Virgo along the path of Sanctuary, Shaka has played a pivotal role chiefly in the battle between Athena and the Pope in the Sanctuary arc, and also in the Hades arc. He is referred to many times on the story as the \"the man who is almost a god\" (or closest to attain godhood) due to his immense power and is also considered the only Gold Saint that has full control over the Araya Shiki (8th sense).\n\nShaka alone of all saints occupies the rarefied spot between God and man, but living between two worlds has its blessings as well as curses. As a Bodhisattva, and endowed with the most powerful cosmos of all the saints even overpowering Libra Dohko's and Aries Shion's Cosmos, Shaka well deserves his reputation as the man closest to God. Even as a child in India, Shaka was precocious and communed with God himself--a scene recounted in the flashbacks moments before Shaka's death in the Twin Sala's Garden. For someone whose life has just begun, he had been unusually sensitive to sufferings and mortality of human life. Seeing pain and death as reflected in the Ganges gives the boy Shaka enough despair, if not a crisis of faith. With esoteric learning and training, Shaka eventually became powerful enough to don the Gold Cloth of Virgo, which he wore even as a boy in the manga, and wise enough to rise above human passions and attachments. For most of his life, he would look on human feelings with a mix of pity and compassion without being bound to them, with charity but not always with love. Detachment seems to be Shaka's answer to the poignant questions raised by human life, and he is seeing humanity from the point of God rather than living the experience. He would be disabused of this attitude in his encounter with Ikki. In the end, Shaka would have to remember that he is a man, as well, and return to whence he came.\n\nHe often casts illusions to deceive his enemies. A probably illusionary technique is Transmigration (or Reincarnation) to the Six Paths (\u516d\u9053\u8f2a\u5efb Rikud\u014d Rinne?) in which Shaka sends his opponent to one of the six Dharma's rebirth realms. These realms are, as described by Kurumada: Gakikai (the realm of the preta), Jinkai (the realm of humans), Jigokukai (the realm of hell), Chikush\u014dkai (the realm of beasts), Shurakai (the realm of the warring demigods) and finally Tenkai (the realm of heaven). Interestingly enough, Kurumada presents the Buddhist realms of reincarnation as separate planes of existence from those found in the Hades arc of his manga, which he derived from Dante Alighieri's conception of the underworld. The Tenkai is considered the worst realm to be sent as mentioned by Shaka.\n\nShaka strengthens his Cosmos energy by depriving himself of his eyesight. When he opens his eyes, the stored strength is then released. Due to his enormous power, Shaka is called the \"man who is closest to god\". He can also use H\u0101\u1e43 (\u30ab\u30fc\u30f3 K\u0101n?), a defensive technique that creates a barrier that encircles Shaka's body.\n\nBetween his offensive techniques he can use Demon Pacifier (\u5929\u9b54\u964d\u4f0f Tenma K\u014dfuku?) to expand his cosmos at multiple targets or at a single one as a blast, that it was strong enough to destroy a large part of the Cancer Temple and Heaven Supremacy on evil spirits of rivers and mountains (\u5929\u7a7a\u8987\u90aa\u9b51\u9b45\u9b4d\u9b4e Tenk\u016bhajachimim\u014dry\u014d?) in which Shaka summons minor spirits and sends them against his enemies.\n\nShaka's most powerful move, The Treasures of Heavens (\u5929\u821e\u5b9d\u8f2a Tenbuh\u014drin?), is an offensive and defensive combined technique. Not only traps and defangs Shaka's victims, it also wipes out their five senses named as \"Remove of the 1st\/2nd\/3rd\/4th\/5th sense\" (Dai Ikkan\/Nikan\/Sankan\/Yonkan\/Gokan Hakudatsu). Essentially reduces Shaka's victims to living corpses by stopping the main functions of the brain that allows the body to think, also called the 6th sense. The offensive power of this attack is so destructive that it can easily destroy the cloth of the opponent.\n\nApart from those fighting techniques, Shaka also uses two concentration ones that belong to the Hinduism and buddhism like Om(\u0950) to maximize his Cosmo energy, allowing him to use the full extent of his power and Tenp\u014drin Mudra (\u8ee2\u6cd5\u8f2a\u5370 Tenp\u014drin'in?) to erase any doubts in his mind that could refrain him during the fight. Tenp\u014drin is the japanese name for the Dharmacakra."},{"mal_id":62939,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/62939\/Miho_Nishizumi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/306124.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/306124.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/306124t.webp"}},"name":"Miho Nishizumi","name_kanji":"\u897f\u4f4f \u307f\u307b","nicknames":["Miporin","Mihosha"],"favorites":544,"about":"Three sizes: B82-W56-H84\n\nShe was born into the distinguished family of the Nishizumi Style of Sensha-dou, but she changed schools to Ooarai Girls Academy intending to run away from Sensha-dou.\n\nHowever, perplexingly enough, she was extorted into joining Sensha-dou by the student council.

The spirit of Zangetsu resembles a 30 to 40 year-old man, and Ichigo calls him \"old man\" (\u304a\u3063\u3055\u3093 ossan) as a result. Zangetsu has also been called the \"black-clothed man\" (\u9ed2\u8863\u306e\u7537 kokui no otoko). Zangetsu is portrayed as wise and calm in most matters, and fond of testing Ichigo in unusual ways, many of which have a purpose completely contrary to the stated goal. Zangetsu has displayed the ability to temporarily close fatal wounds during combat, though whether or not this is a unique ability is unclear. Unlike most zanpakuto, Zangetsu has no release command. The shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an over sized, though more elegant, cleaver blade without a hilt guard. The sword is as tall as Ichigo is, 1.74 meters, and has a black blade with a silver edge. When not in combat, the cloth extends to cover the rest of the sword and falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size. The cloth can also be used to swing the weapon like a flail and toss it at opponents, but this is rarely done. \n\nThe bankai of Zangetsu, named Tensa Zangetsu (\u5929\u9396\u65ac\u6708, lit. heavenly chained cutting moon), is considered completely out of the ordinary for any zanpakut\u014d. Unlike most bankai forms, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Ichigo's bankai actually shrinks his sword down to a dait\u014d (Japanese long sword) with a black blade, handguard in the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for \"ban,\" meaning \"full\"). The cloth wrapped around the hilt is replaced by a short chain with a broken link, similar to that of a plus spirit. In addition to his sword, Ichigo's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat with red lining that is closed at his chest, much like that of Zangetsu himself. \n\n\nZangetsu's special ability (in either form) is the getsuga tensh\u014d (\u6708\u7259\u5929\u885d, lit. moon fang heaven stab, Viz: Moon-Fang Piercer of the Heavens), which fires concentrated energy blasts from the tip of the blade in the shape of a crescent moon. \n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":316,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/316\/Yuuichi_Aizawa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/58384.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/58384.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/58384t.webp"}},"name":"Yuuichi Aizawa","name_kanji":"\u76f8\u6ca2 \u7950\u4e00","nicknames":[],"favorites":543,"about":"Age: 17\nEye Color: Amber\nHair Color: Light Brown\nHeight: 173cm\nWeight: 64kg\n\nYuuichi Aizawa is the main protagonist of Kanon.
