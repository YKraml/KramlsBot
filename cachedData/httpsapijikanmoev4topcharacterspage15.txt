Grell's tea is said to be far inferior to Sebastian's.\n\nMeek, easily scandalized, and highly nervous, Grell's personality is entirely at odds with her mistress'. As a result, the other characters tend to either ignore or walk all over Grell.\n\n\n\nGrell uses feminine pronouns and has more than a passing interest in Sebastian; at one point Grell compares the two of them to Romeo and Juliet during their battle (leaving Sebastian horrified). Though having an interest in Sebastian, it was stated that her 'true love' is William. Overall, Grell appears to have a tenuous grasp on sanity at best, switching from childish irritation to murderous rage at the drop of a hat.\n\nLike a typical death god, Grell possesses a scythe; however, she had it transformed into a chainsaw because she considered a regular scythe to be old-fashioned. Grell explains that the scythe is capable of cutting through anything; when it cuts through a person, it divides their soul and their memories, thus resulting in that person's memories playing before their eyes."},{"mal_id":17364,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/17364\/Momo_Belia_Deviluke","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/273413.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/273413.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/273413t.webp"}},"name":"Momo Belia Deviluke","name_kanji":"\u30e2\u30e2\u30fb\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30fc\u30af","nicknames":[],"favorites":5881,"about":"Birthday: August 8\nAge: 14\nHeight: 151 cm\nWeight: 45 kg\nBWH: 80-54-79\n\nLala's younger sister and Nana's twin; they are introduced when they have most of the characters in a virtual game world created by Lala that they subsequently modify.

The most striking thing about Shanks is the color of his red hair, of which his nick-name \"Red Haired Shanks\" comes from. He also has three scars across his left eye, which were given to him by Blackbeard a long time ago. He has a missing left arm, that he had lost when he saved Luffy from a Sea King. Shanks and his crew are almost always seen partying and drinking alcoholic beverages whenever they make an appearance as the Captain's favorite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets.\n\nAccording to Oda, Shanks is the one character that resembles himself the most out of all the One Piece characters, because of his fun-loving partying nature."},{"mal_id":16589,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/16589\/Toua_Tokuchi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/90985.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/90985.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/90985t.webp"}},"name":"Toua Tokuchi","name_kanji":"\u6e21\u4e45\u5730 \u6771\u4e9c","nicknames":[],"favorites":5617,"about":"Tokuchi Toua is the main character of One Outs series.\n\nHe is a successful gambler and a pitcher in the gambling game based on baseball called \u201cOne Outs\u201d. After losing a game of One Outs for the first time to the Lycaons' cleanup batter (Hiromichi Kojima), he joins the Lycaons team with an odd contract \u2013 the \u201cOne Outs Contract\u201d \u2013 that decides Toua's pay based on his performance.\n\nArguably, the most fearsome trait of Tokuchi is his perceptive intellect, which he uses to manipulate professional baseball. As a baseball pitcher, he psychologically manipulates and intimidates the batters he faces along with playing high-stakes psychological and intellectual battles against his own antagonistic team owner, competing team coaches, and underhanded opposing teams. As the Lycaons' famed star pitcher, he can pitch entire games without giving up a single hit.\n\nTokuchi's most important skill is probably his ability to \u201cseemingly read minds\u201d.

She has a bright and cheerful personality. Yotsuba is the only sister who accepts Fuutarou from the start and wholeheartedly supports him in everything.\n\nYotsuba is an active, cheerful and calm girl. She speaks in a loud, spontaneous and sometimes absent-minded manner. She is the type of person who can't say no to people who need help, and is mostly seen helping people, either directly or indirectly.\n\nWhile cheerful on the outside and towards others, Yotsuba also harbors feelings of inferiority towards her sisters and her own abilities. Her inferiority complex began to grow when she met Fuutarou when they were children, and surprised him by talking to his sister all the time by realizing that he didn't know it wasn't her. She had made several attempts to fix her complex, which in turn made her desire to be different from her sisters stronger. While she was portrayed as a bad liar early on, she is later shown to have some knack for lying to herself; being able to hide her true identity from Fuutarou all the time and being able to maintain their relationship, at least when they are together.\n\nYotsuba is good at sports, the basketball club even asked her to join the team. Yotsuba's excellent sporting ability is shown, scoring in 7.9 seconds for a 50m sprint. Yotsuba is praised as a skilled player by a member of the basketball club. She also has excellent stamina and is a good runner.\n\nYotsuba is the only known sister with excellent eyesight (Itsuki wears glasses and Nino wears contact lenses). Yotsuba got a part-time job doing cleaning-related jobs. Yotsuba is good at festival games. Yotsuba's excellent eyesight is shown again, when she is able to recognize the name tag on Nino's uniform from the second floor. Miku will notice if Yotsuba is lying to her, because according to Fuutarou, Yotsuba is bad at lying. Yotsuba's poor academic skills are first hinted at and shown when she gets a zero for a test. Yotsuba comments that she is the one most likely to repeat a year. Yotsuba's excellent eyesight and kind demeanor are first shown when Fuutarou drops his exam sheet and she returns it to him.\n\n\n(Source: Gotoubun no Hanayome Wiki)"},{"mal_id":8631,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/8631\/Shiro","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/114507.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/114507.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/114507t.webp"}},"name":"Shiro","name_kanji":"\u30b7\u30ed","nicknames":[],"favorites":5559,"about":"A mysterious albino girl that Ganta encountered during his first days as an inmate.
