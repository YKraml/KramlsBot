Though he enjoys lazing around and simply enjoying himself, most of the games focus on the main antagonist Dr. Robotnik attempting to take over the world, only to be stopped by Sonic and occasionally several of his friends every time.\n\nHis best friend is Miles Prower, more commonly called Tails. Acting as somewhat of a sidekick and slowly maturing into more of a partner as the games go on, the young fox has a knack for inventing things and other machinery.\n\nLots of times he'll also team up with Knuckles the Echidna, guardian of the Master Emerald. He's been called his rival on several occasions and the two get along well (most of the time).\n\nSonic is prideful and hates to be constrained, enjoying freedom and doing things at his own pace (which is always incredibly fast).

The cause of these drastic changes is still unknown, although he has regular therapy sessions to determine why.\n\nRitsuka, on his first day at his new school, meets Soubi Agatsuma for the first time. Soubi confuses him with his sudden intimacy and puzzling claims that he was Seimei's fighter. As Ritsuka discovers, Seimei's impromptu will dictates that Soubi shall \"become Ritsuka's\" upon his death. Ritsuka deeply admired and idolized Seimei, and to discover later there were many things kept secret came as a great shock. It further poisoned his difficulty in trusting others, particularly Soubi.\n\nDespite his young age and inexperience due to his amnesia, Ritsuka is very intelligent and approaches things with startling maturity. The circumstances of his life encourage his lack of innocence; however, there have been notable incidents that bare his still-strong naivety, particularly in sexual love and dating. Despite this, he still has firm opinions and unrelenting ideas about those subjects. It is these opinions that clash dramatically with adults and authority figures around him, most notably Soubi. Ritsuka is a pacifist, and strongly opposes violence under any circumstance. Soubi has remained fairly silent on the issue; however, he seemingly doesn't object to pain and punishment under certain circumstances.\n\nLove is an uncomfortable subject for Ritsuka. He is wary of compliments, and doesn't like hearing phrases such as \"I like you.\" Early on in the series, Soubi says \"I love you\" frequently, which Ritsuka doesn't believe is true. Because of Ritsuka's cynical reaction, Soubi stops saying it altogether after volume 2 of the manga. Still, Ritsuka's inner conflict over whether he believes what Soubi says becomes a source of great tension and bitterness in their relationship. \n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":29502,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/29502\/Gildarts_Clive","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/196483.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/196483.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/196483t.webp"}},"name":"Gildarts Clive","name_kanji":"\u30ae\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30c4\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4","nicknames":["Ace of Fairy Tail"],"favorites":915,"about":"Gildarts Clive is one of the Fairy Tail Guild's S-Class mages. Gildarts is widely accepted by all the members as the strongest member in the guild under Makarov. Whether or not he is as powerful as Makarov is widely debated. He is frequently absent in the guild due to the nature of the requests he receives. He is widely referred by members of the Fairy Tail Guilds as \"that geezer\". His back shows a man with spikey hair, wearing a tattered cloak. His infamy as a mage was also commented upon by the Guild Master of Phantom Lord, Jose Porla: \"... Erza and Laxus, Mystogan and Gildarts... Their names spread as far as my own hometown...\"\n\nGildarts went out of the guild 3 years ago to carry out his job, and recently has returned to the guild. He is rumoured to have taken both a 10-year-job as well as a 100-year-job, which is classified above the SS rank jobs as the difficulty is ranked on how long it would take for completion. His long-term periodic absences may be the reason for Makarov's decision for dropping Gildarts out of equation as his successor, and why no attempt of communication was made during the Phantom-Fairy Tail War.\n\nHe also seems to be an incredibly popular and important mage throughout the town as well, as his impending arrival is subject to a large bell being rung in a \"special manner\" to notify people of his coming. Also the Fairy Tail mages seem to burst into celebration as a reaction to his arrival, indicating that unlike Mystogan who is virtually unknown and Laxus who was generally disliked due to his attitude, he is extremely well liked by the town and everyone at Fairy Tail."},{"mal_id":24419,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/24419\/Mahiru_Inami","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/86802.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/86802.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/86802t.webp"}},"name":"Mahiru Inami","name_kanji":"\u4f0a\u6ce2\u307e\u3072\u308b","nicknames":[],"favorites":915,"about":"Height: 166 cm\nWeight: 52 kg\n\nInami is a timid, 17-year-old girl who joins the rest of the employees at Wagnaria. She has androphobia and is thus terrified of men; she punches any male that comes near her. This violent behavior arises from her belief that every man is ready to attack her, but instead she is prone to violently attacking men at a moment's notice due to this fear. This androphobia was caused by her father who did not want her to eventually wed due to jealousy and thus told her that males would attack her, which ended in her fearing men since then. As she and Souta usually share shifts, he takes the brunt of her attacks. However, she makes considerable progress with her fear of men by taking it out on Souta; she states that she is able to be about two meters close to guys without having the urge to hit them. Though this extends to only having fairly civil conversations (often ruined by Souta's rudeness) or if Inami launches an attack on him.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":114,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/114\/Athrun_Zala","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/92453.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/92453.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/92453t.webp"}},"name":"Athrun Zala","name_kanji":"\u30a2\u30b9\u30e9\u30f3\u30fb\u30b6\u30e9","nicknames":["Alex Dino"],"favorites":914,"about":"Age: 16 (GS), 18 (GSD), 20 GSMovie\nBirthday: October 29\nBlood type: O\nGenetic type: Coordinator\nHeight: 170 cm (GS), 174 cm (GSD) 178cm GSmovie\nMobile suit: GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam\n                   ZGMF-1000\/M ZAKU Warrior\n                   ZGMF-X23S Saviour Gundam\n                   ZGMF-2000 GOUF Ignited \n                   ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam\n                   ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice Gundam   \n                        \n                   \n  \nGundam SEED\n\nA member of the elite Le Creuset  team which attacks Heliopolis, Athrun subsequently becomes the pilot of the captured Aegis Gundam. As a child, Athrun attended a preparatory school on the moon, where he became good friends with Kira Yamato. Now, with his father leading the most warlike faction of the PLANT Supreme Council  and his mother among the casualties of the \"Bloody Valentine\" tragedy, Athrun is determined to defeat the treacherous Earth Alliance - and shocked to discover that Kira is fighting on the side of the enemy. Athrun has a talent for mechanical tinkering, and has created numerous robot pets for his friends and acquaintances.\n\nGundam SEED Destiny\n\nThe famous Athrun Zala took up residence in Orb after the end of the previous war, taking on the alias Alex Dino and assisting Cagalli as her aide and bodyguard. When he accompanies Cagalli to Armory One for a meeting with Chairman Durandal, Athrun is drawn into the new conflict, and with the fall of Junius Seven and the outbreak of full-scale war he decides to cast aside his false identity and return to the battlefield.\n\nOn the field of battle, Athrun Zala excels piloting just about anything. When he pilots a standard mobile suit ZAKU warrior (Phase 1), he is able to pilot it with immense skill and bravery. Noted for his skills, Durandal provides Athrun with Saviour, one of the new Gundams. He is extremely agile and fast and makes use of power, speed, and skill all at the same time. However, despite his improved skills, he cannot easily defeat enemy Gundam pilots such as the experimental Earth Alliance pilots. With that being said, although his skills in combat have a definite increase, they are not as skilled as that of Kira Yamato. After his Saviour is destroyed in battle with Freedom, Athrun gets the Infinite Justice and fights alongside Kira's Strike Freedom."},{"mal_id":123343,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/123343\/Vanilla","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/346616.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/346616.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/346616t.webp"}},"name":"Vanilla","name_kanji":"\u30d0\u30cb\u30e9","nicknames":[],"favorites":912,"about":"Breed: White Cat Mix\nHeight: 149 cm\nThree sizes: 70-52-75\nLikes: Chocola\n\nVanilla is quiet, calm and very stoic.
