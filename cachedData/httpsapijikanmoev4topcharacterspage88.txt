He is responsible for the upkeep of Nazarick and the Ainz Ooal Gown. He was created by Momonga himself.\n\nDressed in a nazi uniform, Pandora's Actor is an egghead with no distinct facial feature except the three holes on his face. In Ainz's original design, he is the combination of everything that Ainz think is cool which included exaggerated gestures and body language.\n\nPandora's Actor is an egghead whose behavior is always overly exaggerated, humiliating Ainz. However, while he is over the top, he can also be extremely practical. Unlike other NPCs who willingly obey every order without question, Pandora's Actor will ask questions to clarify his duties and give suggestions whenever possible. Thus, despite his personality, he can be the perfect executioner of all his master's tasks without misunderstanding his intentions.\n\nLike other inhabitants of Nazarick, Pandora's Actor is loyal to the 41 Supreme Beings. However, he is completely devoted to Ainz, his creator, and would even fight the other guild members if ordered to.\n\nPandora's Actor is one of the smartest, most tactical, and powerful NPC by setting, but often uses his talents in some strange matters. As a higher-tier doppelg\u00e4nger, he has an ability to mimic a player including the Ainz Ooal Gown guild members, but receives penalties in all attributes.\n\nHis main ability is to shape-shift into other people. While he has taken on another person's form, he can use all of their abilities and skills but only up to 80% of their output. He has 45 different forms he can take and among those include all of the Supreme Beings' as Momonga wanted to preserve their shape. Because of this, while not as strong as some of the other guardians, he is the most diverse, capable of taking on the shape that will have the greatest effect.\n\n(Source: Overlord Wiki)"},{"mal_id":2009,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2009\/Ino_Yamanaka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/60062.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/60062.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/60062t.webp"}},"name":"Ino Yamanaka","name_kanji":"\u5c71\u4e2d \u3044\u306e","nicknames":[],"favorites":559,"about":"Personal Data:\nBirthday: September 23\nHoroscope: Libra\nGender: Female\nAge: 12-13 (Part I), 16 (Part II)\nHeight: 149.3 cm (4'89'')-151.2 cm (4'96'') (Part I), 162.2 cm (5'32'') (Part II)\nWeight: 38.2 kg-38.5 kg (Part I), 46 kg (Part II)\nBlood Type: B\nClan: Yamanaka clan\nFamily: Inoichi Yamanaka (Father)\nAffiliation: Konohagakure\nTeam:\n\nRank: Genin (Part I), Ch\u016bnin (Part II)\nRegistration ID: 012604\nAcademy Grad.

She acted like a mentor, being tougher and more confident. Under her influence, Sakura began to develope her own identity. Though close to Ino, Sakura could not help but feel she was in her shadow and upon learning they liked the same boy, ended their friendship so that they could compete for his affection, beginning a bitter rivalry. Ino shed her tomboyish look in retaliation and was more open about her feelings towards Sasuke. The rivalry stays till the Chunin Exam. Nevertheless, they have a competitive relationship. She became somewhat superficial, thinking highly of her looks and has no problem telling people what she thinks, no matter how hurtful, such as telling Choji that he should focus more on his appearance because girls dislike overweight boys. On the surface of things, both of her teammates fit the profiles of people she wouldn't associate with because of her apparent shallowness, but she actually cares deeply for their well-beings and maintains a strong bond with them. It should be noted that while Ino is portrayed as shallow she came to Sakura's aid in the Forest of Death despite their feud. She cares very much about her friends, showing deep loyalty.\n\nAs a member of the Yamanaka clan, Ino works in her family's flower shop and has become particularly talented in ikebana. She has been noted to be sharp upon occasion, such as noticing Asuma's affection for Kurenai or using chakra cleverly. The anime's filler arcs show that she's been able to find other uses for her time in the shop and can tell a person's profession by simply glancing at the condition of their hands. Being a Yamanaka has also shaped the mind-altering jutsu she uses. With the Mind Body Switch Technique, Ino can transfer to another's body and use it for a time. The anime explains her medical abilities. During the final filler arc, Ino finds herself of no use to her teammates and becomes awed of Sakura's skills. As such, Ino becomes Tsunade's second apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends. The anime has also shown that Ino has developed her own inner-self named \"Inner Ino\". She, along with team 10 plus Kakashi, aids in the dispersion of two of Akatsuki's members."},{"mal_id":17712,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/17712\/Yuzuki_Eba","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/217737.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/217737.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/217737t.webp"}},"name":"Yuzuki Eba","name_kanji":"\u679d\u8449 \u67da\u5e0c","nicknames":[],"favorites":559,"about":"Birthplace: Tokyo\nBirthday: August 3\nHeight: 155 cm\nWeight: ?

The bet in question is that Mariya, and his twin sister each attend schools for the opposite gender, and if they can stick that out for three years, the winner shall become head of both schools. There is a catch, and that must be that nobody can find out their true gender.

His name means \"Yellow Monkey\" in Japanese while his original name was Borsalino. He was first mentioned by Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji.\n\nKizaru is a middle aged man with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face. He has appeared in a yellow striped suit with the standard Marines' coat over it. He wears shades and a portable Den Den Mushi on his wrist. He is very tall, about the same height as Aokiji.\n\nThe way Kizaru's character design is drawn resembles the famous Japanese actor, Kunie Tanaka. \n\nKizaru's personality appears a combination of the more laid-back Aokiji and the more ruthless Akainu. \n\nLike Aokiji, Kizaru seems to be very laid-back and easygoing, even in surprising and unexpected situations, but he's apparently never shocked. Even when a pirate fired a gunshot at him, he seemed to be focused only on calling his subordinate, and didn't even mind. He even asked the offenders where his subordinate was. After uprooting a mangrove tree, he laughed to himself that the force he used was a tad excessive. He's also very calm and cool-headed, even in tense situations, such as when Basil Hawkins appeared unharmed by his attack, or when Rayleigh appeared. Unfortunately, he can be quite absent-minded and irresponsible, judged by the fact he used a lot of power in a kick directed at escaping pirates, uprooted an entire mangrove tree, and tried to call Sentoumaru with a black Den Den Mushi, which is only for intercepting communications. He also seems to prefer his original name, Borsalino, rather than his alias, as shown when Sentoumaru called him and he said, \"This is Borsalino\". \n\nHowever, more in line with Akainu, he is shown to have a ruthless side: he gives criminals, in particular pirates, very little mercy once he has targeted them. He even planned to capture Silvers Rayleigh, who had given up pirating over twenty years earlier, simply because he was the first mate of the Jolly Roger Pirates. Following the events of the Sabaody Archipelago, Kizaru has captured 500 pirates out of spite. Also like Smoker and Sengoku, he sees the Shichibukai as nothing more than just pirates, even if they are on the World Government's side.\n\nAs an Admiral, Kizaru commands vast numbers of Marine troops that are under his rank. Most of all, he has the ability to order a Buster Call attack on any island.\n\nKizaru possesses the power of the Pika Pika no Mi, meaning glimmer or light, a Logia-type Devil Fruit. As a Logia-user, he is able to let objects pass through him and reconstruct his body from energy particles. He's as fast as light. All of his attacks are based on the element of light, such as firing energy blasts from his finger tips or feet. His power is very destructive, causing huge explosions and easily destroying buildings.\n\nKizaru has shown considerable skill with a sword as he is able to duel Silvers Rayleigh to a draw despite his loss of intangibility.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wiki)"},{"mal_id":138035,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/138035\/Zero","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/328901.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/328901.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/328901t.webp"}},"name":"Zero","name_kanji":"\u30bc\u30ed","nicknames":["Witch of the Darkness"],"favorites":548,"about":"A mage that Mercenary met in the woods.
