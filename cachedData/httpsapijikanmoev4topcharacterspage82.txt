Negi Springfield is the son of master mage Nagi Springfield, famously known as the legendary \"Thousand Master\" and princess Akira of the Ostian Empire in the magic world. At present, Negi has formed 11 temporarily pactio with his students (Asuna, Nodoka, Setuna, Konoka, Yue, Haruna, Chisame, Kazumi, Kaede, Kuu Fei, and Chachamaru) and 1 temporarily pactio with Theo, which gives him the artifact that allow him to use any of his partner's artifact.\n\nNegi specialize in Wind spells and Lightning spells (his father's specialty) though he is initially lacking in battle experience. He later trains under Ku Fei in Martial Arts to make up for his weakness in close combat, advancing very quickly (even learning how to do instant movement, otherwise known as shundou), and applies a strong magical barrier around himself to avoid damaging his frail body. He eventually becomes a master of using delayed spells as a battle tactic. Due to the training he had with Evangeline and Jack Rakan, his magic and combat capability increases exponentially. Negi also learns and improves upon Evangeline's \"Magia Erebea,\" which absorb offensive spells into his own body. He also came up with a new spell: \"Spell Synthesis: Lightning God Lance Titan Slayer\" which is a new high class lightning spell. Negi even manage to use Magia Erebea's ultimate ability by using a magic circle that can stop and absorb the enemy's attack whether it is magical or spiritual attack and use it against them, which even Evangeline herself could not master it. In the latest chapter, it is shown that Magia Erebea marks have begin to spread all over Negi's body and that Negi has formed a temporarily pactio with Shiori, one of Fate's subordinates.\n\nHis aim is to become a Magister Magi (master mage) like his father and find his father who is currently missing."},{"mal_id":158454,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/158454\/Kei_Yonagi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/398173.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/398173.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/398173t.webp"}},"name":"Kei Yonagi","name_kanji":"\u591c\u51ea \u666f","nicknames":[],"favorites":618,"about":"Age: 17\nBirth date: May 15\nHeight: 168 cm\nBlood type: A\nOccupation: Actress\nAffiliation: Studio Daikokuten\n\nFavorite Food: fish, Japanese foods like hijiki and natto and western foods like hamburger or curry.\nSpecial Skills: sprint, long jump and general exercise for individual competition (she isn't good at ball games).\nFavorite Movies: Roman Holiday, Casablanca and Gone with the Wind.\n\nA high school girl who's all alone to raise her twin siblings, Rui and Rei, ever since their mother died and their father left home.

Sophie rescues him from the wasteland, and now he follows her around.\n\nIn the book Turnip Head is actually the king's brother, Justin, who had disappeared after searching for the missing Wizard Suliman. The witch of the waste took him and mixed some of his body parts with Suliman's, in order to make the perfect man, who she could make the new king. The scarecrow, who does not have a name, was actually summoned by Suliman to inform someone of his and Prince Justin's whereabouts."},{"mal_id":12984,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/12984\/Kyousuke_Hyoubu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/198007.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/198007.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/198007t.webp"}},"name":"Kyousuke Hyoubu","name_kanji":"\u5175\u90e8 \u4eac\u4ecb","nicknames":["Major"],"favorites":611,"about":"Hyoubu is the leader of P.A.N.D.R.A. and the series' major antagonist. Despite having the appearance of a high schooler, he is at least 80 years old, but makes use of his powers to conserve his youth. As is the case with Kaoru's berserk runaway telekinesis, Kyousuke has the capability to defy fully powered-up ESP Counter Measure generators but does so as \"the rule\". Given that there are few efficacious avenues for damaging him (never mind the subjugation and confinement), Kyousuke believes that he can demonstrate his volition of doing whatever he wishes.\n\nDespite his delight in giving B.A.B.E.L. super fits as he foils all their attempts to apprehend him and using his hypnosis to especially manipulate Minamoto for his own recreational ends (such as effecting the mirage that Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi are physically older than they really are), Kyousuke's misanthropy fortunately does not extend to other espers. He views Kaoru as his queen and soul mate due to her ability to defy the fully powered-up ESP Counter Measure generator and wishes for her to grow up quickly not caring anything that Kaoru is much more like a child than she initially appears as Minamoto is forced to endure on a daily basis. He and Momotarou have a social dynamic where they always see the worst of normal people and behave as if the word of an esper always takes precedence over the word of a normal person\u2014with which they both have had several dysphoric experiences.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":23272,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/23272\/Yakumo_Saitou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/316376.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/316376.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/316376t.webp"}},"name":"Yakumo Saitou","name_kanji":"\u6589\u85e4 \u516b\u96f2","nicknames":[],"favorites":610,"about":"Saitou Yakumo is a college student.

Naturally gifted as a commander and trusted implicitly by others, he strives to live up to their admiration. He's especially close to Mikazuki, who he's known since a very young age; their bond is closer than most blood brothers. His coup within CGS is launched to give the boys a place where they won't be betrayed anymore.\n\nHe has undergone the Alaya-Vijnana System surgery, therefore, his skill and abilities are better than an average mobile pilot. His greatest strength, however, is not his ability to fight, but to lead. His personal charisma, along with his military genius, is what keeps Tekkadan moving forward. His ability to think outside of the box has saved him and his allies on multiple occasions, and that has earned him the respect of both friend and foe and has in one occasion, impressed a foe enough to become his friend.\n\nDespite having a rough childhood and never attending school, he is surprisingly fully capable of reading and writing, and more impressively, in two languages, unlike most children of his circumstances. He loathes sitting at a desk and doing paperwork, but is very capable of getting it done when it comes down to it.\n\n(Source: Gundam.info, edited)"},{"mal_id":2165,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2165\/Mao","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/62934.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/62934.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/62934t.webp"}},"name":"Mao","name_kanji":"\u732b\uff08\u30de\u30aa\uff09","nicknames":["Ricardo"],"favorites":609,"about":"His name means \"cat\" in Chinese.
