He is the world's most wanted thief. Often in his adventures, he takes it upon himself and his gang to foil other criminals engaged in more serious crimes. He sometimes appears incompetent, but mostly as a charade to catch his opponents off guard. While he has been arrested and thrown in jail on several occasions, he has always managed to break out. His infatuation with Fujiko Mine is perhaps his biggest weakness, as it often lands him in undesirable situations. \n\nIn Monkey Punch's original manga, Lupin is cocky, quite crude, and for the most part remorseless. He is very much the ladies' man, often using them for his own gains, and is not beyond forcing himself upon women who resist him. Mike Toole of Anime News Network referred to the character as a \"rough, drunken, lecherous crook.\" This is in stark contrast to his better-known anime self, who although a skilled thief, occasionally comes off as a chivalrous goofball who enjoys helping those less fortunate than he. Furthermore, Lupin often takes it upon himself and his gang to stop criminals engaged in more violent crimes and leave them for Zenigata to arrest. In the anime, while he fancies himself a Casanova, his actual success with women is erratic, appearing to fluctuate with the writer.\n\nEven though his gang's loyalty has been an issue, with Fujiko willing to betray and cohort Goemon promising to eventually kill him, Lupin will still drop everything to come to their aid in a helpless moment; further the team would rather face torture than to betray Lupin (or he betray them) to a third party. This rule of loyalty curiously extends as well to Inspector Zenigata, whom Lupin considers a respected friend and opposition. The Inspector reciprocates this regard and out of gratitude has vowed never to attempt to kill Lupin. Lupin's vendetta against the Tarantula Gang in In Memory of the Walther P-38 was partly settling of past betrayal and mostly vengeful payback for their shooting and nearly killing Zenigata.\n\nIt seems Lupin loves to steal more than actually having the treasure he sought. Lupin relishes more in the challenge of stealing and, as long as he succeeds in the heist, is usually not that upset when he ends up empty-handed; there have been times he has lost the object or intentionally thrown it away. There have also been times when Lupin stole an object only to give it to someone else, such as if it rightfully belonged to them or they needed it more than he did.\n\nWhen not involved in criminal activities, Lupin usually spends his time dating beautiful girls, fishing, race car driving, attending formal dinners, playing pool, casino gambling, and participating in caf\u00e9 society. His favorite foods seem to be mostly French cuisine, sushi, and seafood; when on a job he may settle with ramen noodles. In Lupin the Third Part V, he is shown with an affection for galettes. He also smokes cigarettes and occasionally cigars and kreteks; in the manga, he's seen smoking a briar pipe. His preferred cigarette is the famous French brand Gitanes. Lupin is a celebrated race car driver, competing in several international events when time allows. He's also a skilled sleight of hand artist who loves to befuddle his opponents with various gimmicks: i.e., a cigarette which explodes into confetti, a gun with a spring-loaded boxing glove that clobbers the shooter, and bubble gum that becomes plastique after brief chewing. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Lupin III Wiki)"},{"mal_id":24502,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/24502\/Yuzuru_Otonashi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/434995.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/434995.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/434995t.webp"}},"name":"Yuzuru Otonashi","name_kanji":"\u97f3\u7121\u7d50\u5f26","nicknames":[],"favorites":2940,"about":"Height: 176 cm\nAge: 17\n\nOtonashi lost his memory in an accident and thus thinks his life has no meaning.

To accomplish this goal, he must defeat his arch-rival, Yugi Muto. He is largely considered an anti-hero, as his motives are usually ego-centric, but in several cases towards a good cause. \n\nKaiba was first introduced as a prodigious, cold-hearted gamer who stopped at nothing to achieve his goals, even resorting to seemingly killing his opponents. He lived a bad childhood because of his good for nothing stepfather. When Kaiba learned that Yugi's grandfather possesses a \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" card, he ends up dueling Yami Yugi and lost while ending up in a coma after Yami used his power to momentarily shatter Kaiba's heart to purge it of his evil. Though reformed, later learning his rival's identity to be Atem, Kaiba retains his arrogance and rivalry with Yugi. While Kaiba leaves the story following the Battle City arc, he appears in the anime adaption as a major character and has been mentioned in sequel Yu-Gi-Oh! GX series as the founder of Duel Academy. Among one of the recurring plots in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters is Seto Kaiba being forced to deal with either people adversely affected by Gozaburo Kaiba's actions wanting to take their revenge on Seto Kaiba, or people from within KaibaCorp attempting to take over the corporation.  \n\nHe can be condescending, selfish, no-nonsense, and narcissistic, but, as Yami Yugi has said he can be oblivious at times. However, it is stated by Mokuba ever since being adopted by Gozaburo, Kaiba became much colder than he used to be. Despite this, Kaiba still has strong brotherly instincts for Mokuba and will put his life in danger in a heart beat to safeguard Mokuba's life. Apart from Mokuba, Kaiba has compassion for children\u2014especially orphans (as he himself was one and knew what it felt like). Kaiba also threw himself between Zorc and two Egyptian children, thus enabling them to make a getaway. At various points during the series, he opens up momentarily, performing kind acts, though always covering them up with sarcasm, and denying them if asked. These occurrences increase in frequency towards the later series. Aside from that, Kaiba maintains a conservative, stiff, and uptight exterior. Like the Pharaoh, pride is Kaiba's strength and weakness; he never backs down from a fight and gives everything he can in a Duel. This results in his sense of superiority and sense of arrogance, making it extremely difficult to earn his respect, and causes him to look down on and treat others as inferior until they do so. This gives him difficulty when forced to rely on others and work as a team. His pride in himself and his accomplishments is a prominent part of his character throughout the series, and he reacts harshly to those who threaten or infringe on it (although it is toned down slightly towards the end). \n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Yugipedia)"},{"mal_id":87267,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/87267\/Mikoto_Mikoshiba","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/307566.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/307566.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/307566t.webp"}},"name":"Mikoto Mikoshiba","name_kanji":"\u5fa1\u5b50\u67f4 \u5b9f\u7434","nicknames":["Mikorin"],"favorites":2841,"about":"Age: 16-17\nBirthday: February 14 (Aquarius)\nClass: 2-G\nClub: Go-Home club\nHeight: 177 cm\nBlood type: A\n\nMikoto Mikoshiba, also known as Mikorin, is one of Nozaki's assistants and Yuu Kashima's best friend and classmate.\n\nMikoto attracts the attention of many girls, and is admired by the males as well.
