Soujiro is known for his lack of kenki or, simply, emotion. He possesses no anger and cites no fear in his enemies, other than with his sword.\n\nSoujirou is often seen smiling and has polite manners, always referring to others with Japanese suffixes. He is sarcastic, hiding his true emotions behind his smiling face. He however does have a special relationship with Yumi, she being a sister figure towards him. Soujirou usually dresses up in a blue kimono with white handguards\n\nSoujiro's constantly smiling face and polite manners stem from his tragic past. Born in Kanagawa Prefecture during the first year of Bunkyuu (1861), Soujiro is an illegitimate child. S\u014dujiro's father left him in the care of his family, who badly mistreat him. He is assigned chores such as carrying rice to and from the family warehouse, and whenever he faltered, he was beaten by his family. Soujiro built a defense against their lashings; he put on a smiling face, and endured the torture until they got tired of beating him and left him alone.\n\nOne night, he meets Shishio, who was on the run from the police. Soujiro witnesses Shishio kill some police officers and Shishio is about to kill him for it until he notices Soujiro smiling and therefore spares him in exchange for food and bandages. Shishio tells Soujiro that only the strong may live and that his predicament is his own fault for being weak. This new mentality, and a sword given to him by Shishio, determine his defence when his family finds him housing Shishio. Sojiro quickly finds himself cornered by them, attempting to murder him and blame his death on Shishio, and lashes out, killing every one of them at the age of eight.\n\nSoujiro''s apparent lack of emotion, his simple, insensitive mentality that the strong will live and the weak shall die, and his skills make him a formidable foe for Kenshin. As a master swordsman of his own style, Soujirou's abilities have earned him the nickname of \"Heaven's Sword\" (\u5929\u5263, Tenken?, Ten meaning Heaven and Ken meaning Sword, \"Tenken\" means swordsmanship of natural endowments). His shukuchi utilizes such powerful speed that, to an observer, it appears that the distance between the two fighters has shrunk (hence the name shukuchi, which means \"reduced earth\").\n\nDuring his fight with Kenshin, Soujiro continually states he's only moving \"three steps below shukuchi\" or \"two steps below shukuchi.\" While moving at the speed his shukuchi utilizes, the only thing that can be seen is Soujiro's footsteps ripping through the tatami mats. During \"one step below shukuchi\", he is able to attack from an omni-directional angle, utilizing not only horizontal but vertical space While performing true shukuchi, he completely disappears and cannot be seen, even by Kenshin. Soujirou can dodge the Kuzu-ry\u016bsen (\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d\u9583?, lit. \"Nine-headed Dragon Flash\"), a move which apparently cannot be evaded even by Kenshin himself. Soujirou is also the first one ever to slash Kenshin in the back in the series.\n\nSoujiro is also well versed in the Batt\u014djutsu style like Kenshin, as is evident when he decides to use a stance similar to Kenshin's and when he destroys Kenshin's first sakabat\u014d. Combining the true speed of shukuchi with the Batt\u014djutsu, he has created his only named technique, Shuntensatsu (\u77ac\u5929\u6bba?, lit. \"Instant Heaven Kill\"), meaning \"immediate killing by heaven's sword\". It is named this because the speed behind the attack is so swift that the opponent dies instantly before falling to the floor.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":106615,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/106615\/Hibiki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/259363.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/259363.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/259363t.webp"}},"name":"Hibiki","name_kanji":"\u97ff","nicknames":["Verniy"],"favorites":481,"about":"A calm and stoic Russophile who tends to include Russian words in her speech.

Nomura has stated that Riku's name can be seen as \"land\"; the Japanese on'yomi pronunciation of land is riku. Riku is voiced by David Gallagher in the English version and Mamoru Miyano in the Japanese version. He is playable in the second story mode of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and as a world-specific ally in Kingdom Hearts II.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, he is 15 years old and lives on Destiny Islands with his friends. When their world is attacked by the Heartless, the three are separated. Riku ends up at Hollow Bastion where he is found by Maleficent. Under her influence, he becomes an antagonist to help Kairi. Riku eventually becomes possessed by Xehanort's Heartless, the main antagonist of the first game, and is sent to the realm of darkness, where he helps Sora seal the door to the realm of darkness.\n\nIn Chain of Memories, he awakes in the same fortress Sora had arrived at and begins traversing to the top from the basement. Along the way, Riku confronts the remaining darkness in his heart, and also encountered DiZ, a mysterious stranger. Upon reaching the top he finds Namin\u00e9, who is attending to a sleeping Sora to restore his memories. Riku then chose to find a balance between his light and darkness. A replica of Riku was created by Vexen in Castle Oblivion during the events of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and was referred to simply as the Riku Replica.\n\nAfter the events in Chain of Memories, Riku confronted Roxas in order to assist DiZ in reuniting him with Sora. During the fight, he used the power of darkness, which converted Riku into the form of Xehanort's Heartless. For most of the story, Riku remains in this form, helping Sora in secret and never showing his face, not wanting Sora or anyone else to discover what had become of him. Riku returns to his original form by the destruction of a machine intended to convert Kingdom Hearts into data. Afterwards, Riku and Sora battle and defeat Xemnas. In the end, they end up on a dark beach, and discuss how strong their friendship is and how much each of them wanted to be like the other, before a portal opens to Destiny Islands.

She wears a white short sleeve dress and has a small horn on the right side of her forehead and has white, long, choppy, unkempt hair. She also has red eyes. Under her bandages, her arms are shown to have numerous scars.\n\nHer relationship with Chisaki and the Eight Precepts suggest that she has never felt affection in her life. As she has claimed up until now, Izuku's touch was the first time she felt kindness, which overwhelmed her. When murderous intents are directed at her, she does not scream, nor cry and simply remains silent, because instead of bracing for the pain, she knows she has no choice but to accept.\n\nEri is, however, willing to let herself go with Chisaki in order to protect those that help her. She feels guilt over other people being hurt in order to rescue her.\n\nEri is the granddaughter of the ex-Capo of the Yakuza group, The Eight Precepts of Death. At a young age, she accidentally used her newly manifested Quirk on her father and it caused him to vanish. Her Quirk resembled neither of her parents' so her mother believed her existence to be cursed and gave the girl up to her father. Her grandfather then left her in the care of his protege, Kai Chisaki, so that he could test her to identify her Quirk as well be able to sympathize as it seemed as if they had similar Quirks. However, her Quirk was misdiagnosed and was in fact \"Rewind\" and not \"Vanish.\"\n\nChisaki took over the organization and then began to experiment on Eri to turn her Quirk into a weapon. Through unknown means, he discovered that her blood had properties that suppress the bodies' ability to manifest \"Quirk Factor,\" inhibiting someone's Quirk. He manufactured them into bullets that be shot at a target and inject them with her blood. He did this by destroying Eri with his Quirk, collecting blood, and then repairing her. He did this hundreds upon thousands of times, despite Eri's pain.
