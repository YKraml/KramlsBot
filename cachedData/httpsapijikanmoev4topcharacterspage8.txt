However, they are also the Queen's watchdogs; the Phantomhive family keeps an eye on black market dealings in ways that Scotland Yard isn't able to. Ciel Phantomhive is the heir to this legacy.\n\nEarl Ciel Phantomhive is the business-savvy, twelve-year-old (later thirteen-year-old) head of the English Phantomhive noble family, taking over after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He also runs Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, and later adds a food branch after winning a Royal Warrant. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eyepatch, bears a pentacle sign of the Faustian contract which binds the demon Sebastian Michaelis to his will. He also has a brand burnt into his back from when he was sold as a slave after his house was burnt down.\n\nCiel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth Midford. He sees her as an important friend and someone he needs to protect. His parents were killed and his mansion was set ablaze on his birthday, a reason why he does not like to celebrate the occasion. This tragedy causes him to not want to lose anyone important again.\n\nDespite his young age, he runs the family company and, as such, is quite busy much of the time though he still finds time to go out investigating dubious legal matters.\n\nThroughout the series Ciel's height has been used as a tool of mockery due to his short stature. He grows by 6 cm in the second season, but still remains shorter than the other characters, thus continuing the comical relief. Sebastian enjoys teasing Ciel about this fact. In the manga, he does not grow taller.\n\nThe young earl is far more composed and mature than would be expected. He remains distant from others, aloof, preferring to spend his time on work for the company.  He is oftentimes selfish and not able to fully empathize with people. However, he does express occasional concern for the well-being of those close to him.\n\nAs a side note, Ciel seems to enjoy drinking tea a lot (he is adept at distinguishing between them as well) and sweet desserts. He has asthma (inherited from his mother) and dislikes being around cats because they trigger his allergies.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":507,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/507\/Howl","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/83512.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/83512.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/83512t.webp"}},"name":"Howl","name_kanji":"\u30cf\u30a6\u30eb","nicknames":["Jenkins","Pendragon"],"favorites":11416,"about":"Wizard Howl is a mysterious, reclusive wizard.

He was born from a fragment of Shinigami's soul.\n\nBeing the son of Shinigami, Kid was singled out. The other students at Shibusen were afraid to get close to him not only because he was Shinigami's son, but because they were afraid that they'd get hurt. This continued until he became the meister of Liz and Patti. They became good comrades, and even helped Kid. Kid didn't, necessarily, experience friendship until he met the others. He is really grateful to have friends that are not afraid of him like the others at Shibusen.\n\nKid has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, or OCPD, which is manifested as an obsession over perfection. Objects and surroundings that are symmetrical can distract him from missions, and he will usually start to break down and have fits if he notices asymmetrical objects around him. Thus if anything is wrong by any measurement (a picture frame crooked, or not folding his toilet paper, for example), he will try to correct it right away, even at the cost of the mission at hand. He is so obsessed with symmetry that Kid refuses to fight a battle unless everything is symmetrical, as he would be asymmetrical holding only one gun. Even if an enemy is symmetrical in appearance, he will refuse to fight it and harm its symmetry. The fact that the left half of his bangs is marked with three white stripes causes him much stress. As a result of his OCPD, Kid can be very hard on himself if the asymmetry of the stripes in his hair are pointed out by someone, calling himself \"useless asymmetrical garbage\". Kid, trying to make himself completely symmetrical, tried to dye his hair once, but the Sanzu Lines continued to reappear. This is because his reaper body rejects all forms of chemicals and toxins, including artificial coloring like hair dye. The Index of the Book of Eibon referred to this obsession as Madness of Order.\n\nHis favorite number is 8, not only for its symmetry, but for the fact it divides out evenly. An example of one of his fits, and his love for the number 8, can be shown when he met Soul on his first day of DWMA. When Soul said that if Kid had arrived at 7 like he was suppose to he could look around himself. Instead of focusing on the entire comment.. Kid replied \"  \"No, it can't be seven! Say eight, dammit! Eight is better! It's physically impossible to cut the number seven in half and make it symmetrical! It has to be eight instead! Eight cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! Take it back, I beg of you! Please say eight! Please!\", only to become further distressed when Black Star broke one of the spikes tips jutting out of his fathers, perfectly symmetrical, school.\n\nDespite that his father wears a completely asymmetrical cloak, Kid is not bothered by it at all, being that his love for his father outweighs his OCPD. He also doesn't seem to mind that his Death God Martial Art- \"Stance of Sin\" requires him to hold his arms in asymmetrical position. Showing that there are some things he can tolerate.\n\nHe is usually very mature and precise in his ways. Kid is naturally calm and collected, and as such is perfectly fine with other people making their own decisions when it comes to symmetry or otherwise, even if he disagrees with their choices. However, there are times when his obsession with symmetry can greatly affect his usually calm personality and cause him to break down into childish fits.\n\nDue to his serious personality, Kid is unaffected by nudity. While other male characters get nose bleeds, Kid does not. During a battle with a female \"madness clown\" who was trying to distract Kid with her nearly naked body, Patti says, \"Kid-kun is one of those perverts that gets distracted only when you make him rub your breasts! This won't affect him!\", but isn't actually because he is not a pervert, and is more matured than boys his age. Considering Patti is not the smartest person in the world she would think like this. When Kid had to return to DWMA, in order to get back to the fight on the moon sooner, Kid had no problems walking in the girls bathroom to help, only to be dragged out by Liz. Later in the Death Room, Kid is shown to have blood coming out of one side of his nose and mouth, having been punched by either Liz or Kim.\n\nOf course, Kid's being unaffected by nudity may also be the result of being A-Sexual. Given that his father created both him and Asura A-sexually, and Shinigami shows no interest in either gender, even when Spirit hired Blair and her friends to entertain them during their meeting, he showed no interest and was rather confused by their flirtation and later angry at them for goofing off when they should be discussing the rescue of his son. An example to prove this is when Kid had visited Soul and Maka's apartment, when Blair's towel fell off instead of getting a nosebleed like Soul or Black Star, Kid looked rather disgusted.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have any problem socializing and genuinely cares for his friends. He is seen expressing concern about Soul's scar at one point, and threatens Gopher that he will never forgive him if he hurts Maka after Gopher threatens to hurt her in revenge for their original fight. He also threw Patti and Liz away from him before being sucked into the Book of Eibon, not wanting them to be taken with him.\n\nKid generally seems to be somewhat introverted, often working on missions on his own and not having as close of a friendship with Maka or Black\u2606Star as Maka and Black\u2606Star have with each other.\n\nIt is mentioned by Maka that it is normally hard to match soul wavelengths with more than one weapon, but Kid as a highly skilled Meister is able to do so since Liz and Patti have a strong connection with each other and admiration for Kid who gave them a better life.\n\nHis father, Death, has mentioned that Kid is a Shinigami (\"death god\") and does not need to collect souls, but Kid says he wants to make a weapon of his own specifications. His father also says that since he uses two weapons and the guns do not count as a set, he will have to collect twice as many souls: 198 evil human souls and two Witch souls instead of 99 souls and one witch soul. However, he seems perfectly fine with this.\n\nKid shares a side rivalry with Black\u2606Star, and seems to be stronger, however it is possible that he is more susceptible to madness than Black\u2606Star or Maka, for both were able to pull themselves from madness while he quickly succumbed to the Madness of Order in the Book of Eibon, while Black\u2606Star is able to quickly snap himself out of it. This may be because of his OCPD, or simply because of his strong drive to create a perfect world. It is also possible that being a Shinigami, Kid was weaker against the Madness.\n\nAlthough Kid's obsession with symmetry often hinders his performance and focus on missions, he still has good intentions. He wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and help make the world a more peaceful place that is safe from evil."},{"mal_id":702,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/702\/Nana_Osaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/28355.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/28355.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/28355t.webp"}},"name":"Nana Osaki","name_kanji":"\u5927\u5d0e \u30ca\u30ca","nicknames":[],"favorites":11156,"about":"Born: March 5, 1981\nHeight: 162 cm (5'4\")\nWeight: 43 kg (95 lbs.)\nFamily: Misuzu Osaki (mother)\nMiyuki Osaki (grandmother, also foster mother\u2014deceased)\n\nOne of the titular characters of the series, Osaki Nana may look like a tough punk rocker, but she has a kind heart and is a devoted friend.

His real name is unknown, though Accelerator recalls his surname was composed of two characters and his given name consisted of three characters. First appearing as an antagonist of the third light novel, he later becomes a main character and the lead of the science side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series, especially in volumes 5, 8, 12, 13, SS1, SS2, 15, 14, 19, and 20.\n\nA sadistic boy about the same age as Touma, he has an ability called \"Vector Change,\" a form of telekinesis allowing him to change the vector values of anything he touches due in part of having a thin coat of AIM fields surrounding his body. This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person's body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him.\n\nAccelerator's unique ability made him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 ESPer; according to the city's best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index's Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 ESPer without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to \"level up\" Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 3 ESPers: the Misaka clones. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the most powerful and feared ESPer that no one would be foolish enough to challenge and even killed many who got in his way."},{"mal_id":139,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/139\/Allen_Walker","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/72171.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/72171.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/72171t.webp"}},"name":"Allen Walker","name_kanji":"\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc","nicknames":["Crown Clown","God's Joker","Bean Sprout","Short Stack"],"favorites":10885,"about":"Age: 15; 16; 17\nBirthday: Unknown, December 25 (date of adoption)\nHeight: 168 cm (5'6\"), now 174 cm (5'8 1\/2\") \nWeight: 127.9 lbs (58 kg), now 123 lbs (56 kg)\nBlood type: O\nNationality: British \nFavorite food: Mitarashi Dango\n\nBack Story\n\nAllen is the main hero of the series. He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" \u2014 the mark of the Akuma \u2014 which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.\n\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. \n\nAbilities\n\nIn addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.\n\nAllen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed  Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316\uff08\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\uff09, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316, Kami no Douke).\n\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.\n\nWhen facing Tyki yet again, Allen synchronization with his Innocence exceeded 100% which activated his new Crowned Crown ability, Sword of Exorcism. The Sword of Exorcism has the ability to exorcist an Akuma on touch and even the ability to exorcist the Noah Gene from Noah's themselves. What shocked Tyki the most wasn't the ability of the sword but rather the similarity between Allen's Sword of Exorcism and the Millennium Earl's sword.\n\nStory\n\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one."},{"mal_id":164470,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/164470\/Megumi_Fushiguro","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/392689.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/392689.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/392689t.webp"}},"name":"Megumi Fushiguro","name_kanji":"\u4f0f\u9ed2 \u6075","nicknames":[],"favorites":10854,"about":"Species: Human\nAge: 15\nBirthday: December 22\nHeight: 175 cm (5'9\")\nGender: Male\nHair Color: Black\nEyes Color: Green (Manga)\nDark Blue (Anime)\n\nMegumi is a tall, dark-haired boy with blue eyes.

By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash,\" and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death."},{"mal_id":71267,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/71267\/Kenma_Kozume","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417885.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417885.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417885t.webp"}},"name":"Kenma Kozume","name_kanji":"\u5b64\u722a \u7814\u78e8","nicknames":[],"favorites":10611,"about":"Team: Nekoma High School\nAge: 16\nHeight: 169.2 cm\nWeight: 58.3 kg\nBirthday: October 16\nYear: 2nd Year, class 3\nNumber: 5\nPosition: Setter\nFavorite food: Apple pie\nCurrent Concerns: Summer is hot and winter is cold\nAbility Parameters (out of 5): Power = 1; jump = 2; stamina = 2; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 3\n\nKenma has a very relaxed and laid back personality.
