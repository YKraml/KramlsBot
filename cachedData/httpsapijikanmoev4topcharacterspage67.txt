She embodies the traditional Victorian aristocrat. Her favorite words are \"tea\", \"servant\" and \"What?\"  She regularly and nonchalantly delivers physical punishment to Jun, her medium, and in her own eyes, her servant.  She sees it as her duty not only to discipline Jun as her servant, but also to guide him as a guardian.  Shinku may seem cold and unappreciative, but she is highly protective of and cares deeply for her sisters and for Jun. She can be relied on for the occasional bit of parent-like wisdom. Despite her aristocratic quirks, Shinku is the most level-headed doll living in Jun's house.\n\nHowever, her one weakness is her fear of imperfection; a fear that is powerful enough to shatter her normally cool demeanor.  Father put so much effort into her that she feels an obsessive need to become Alice.  In her eyes, the Alice Game is cruel, and she is reluctant to take the souls of her sisters, leaving them as the lifeless \"junk\" they fear more than anything else.\n\nShinku does not use honorific suffixes such as \"-chan,\" \"-san,\" or \"-kun,\" except when she refers to \"Father.\" Despite her relative youth amongst the Rozen Maidens, the other dolls look up to her as an older sister, and a worthy challenger in the Alice Game. Shinku does have a cute side, which is evident in her intense, almost obsessive, admiration for the puppet detective Kun Kun. Jun was once able to win her over during an argument by using a Kun Kun doll. Shinku hates cats because one almost ate her wind-up key in the past.\n\nAlong with being the central doll in the series, Shinku seems to hold a special place in \"Father\"'s heart; he had given her a special brooch with his image when she was created, which Suigintou destroyed out of jealousy. Shinku desires to become \"Alice,\" but she refuses to use deadly force against her sisters and believes that there must be a way to become Alice without taking part in the Alice Game as told to her by \"Father\".\n\nIn combat, Shinku fights with rose petal-based attacks, making her one of the strongest dolls in battle. The rose petals are extremely versatile; Shinku can direct them to spread out for wide-ranging attacks, or group them together to use as a shield. Her other weapon is a cane, which she skillfully wields like a sword. Shinku has other special powers, such as restoring broken objects, typically Jun's bedroom windows after Suiseiseki and Souseiseki show up, with a form of time-reversing magic. Shinku was the second runner-up for both Saimoe 2005 and 2007.\n\nMedium: Jun (All Seasons)\/Sara (In 19th Century)\nArtificial Spirit: Hollie (Called Hollier in Tokyopop translation.)\n\nShinku's name in English means \"True Crimson\"."},{"mal_id":181335,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/181335\/Yoshida","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/420037.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/420037.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/420037t.webp"}},"name":"Yoshida","name_kanji":"\u5409\u7530","nicknames":[],"favorites":842,"about":"The protagonist of the story.\n\nA typical office worker.

Over time, those with \"Advanced Blood\" came to be hated and feared. This forced those with advanced bloods into hiding in order to live in peace. Haku was one of the few people in the Mist with Advanced Blood left.\n\nWhen Haku was just a young child, his father discovered that his wife was part of an Advanced Bloodline. Haku's father proceeded to kill his mother and then went after him. In Haku's fright, he killed his father and fled his small village, believing himself to be a monster: a monster loved by no one.\n\nOn one faithful day, Haku looked up in the slums of the back alley to see a Shinobi staring down at him, this Shinobi was Zabuza. Haku then proclaimed, \"You have the same eyes as me\". Zabuza realized that Haku was one of the Advanced Bloodline limit carriers, and took the child under his wing. Haku was raised by Zabuza as \"a tool\" to be called upon when needed in exchange for his \"freedom\" from the slums. He learned how to use his unique abilities and eventually became a Hunter-Nin. When Zabuza's plan to kill Mizukage fails, Haku fled the village along with Zabuza to fulfill his job as a veritable \"a tool.\"\n\nHaku's slender frame and delicate appearance enables him to disguise himself in various ways. In fact, while finding medicine to treat Zabuza's wounds Haku runs into Naruto. Naruto mistakenly believes Haku is a girl. As we see in the ensuing brawls, it is not appearance that determines strength. Rather, under that soft face we see that Haku has an adroit knack for speed and Jutsu skill. Combined with his knowledge of the human body, Haku can target his opponent's vital organs and kill them instantly using pinpoint accuracy. The main choice to attack these vital organs is with simple needles that are used by physicians in the battle field.\n\nHaku's bloodline originates in the country of Mist so it is no surprise that his Jutsus are water based. His \"Flying Water Needles\" is a technique whence he uses his chakra to create ice needles via water on the ground. Furthermore, he uses his chakra to control the path of the needles and strike the enemy. His other technique, \"Demonic Ice Mirrors\" uses water to create ice mirrors to surround the enemy. He then combines himself with the mirrors and uses the reflection to transport himself from mirror to mirror while attacking his enemy from all angles. His most incredible ability however, is the ability to do one-handed seals. This allows him to complete various tasks that are not capable of being accomplished without having a free hand.\n\nAlthough Haku is an exceptional fighter, he is a kind ninja who is saddened by unnecessary death. His fighting spirit comes from the will to protect his most \"precious person,\" because \"when a person has something precious to protect, that is when they can become truly strong.\""},{"mal_id":115779,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/115779\/Haruhiro","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/301170.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/301170.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/301170t.webp"}},"name":"Haruhiro","name_kanji":"\u30cf\u30eb\u30d2\u30ed","nicknames":["Hal"],"favorites":839,"about":"He is one of the main characters of the story.

Gray-man series, appearing to Allen, Lenalee, and Miranda in the Rewinding City arc. Despite looking as if she is in her early teens, Road is referred to as the oldest of the Noah. Road has an affinity for candies and blood, as well as a childlike enjoyment of birthday-reminiscent themes.\n\nRoad has a plethora of supernatural abilities, ranging from the ability to travel to an alternate dimension through a door that appears at her will to complete regeneration after injury. Her dimensional space is in the form of a wrapped present, while her weapons of choice are levitating candles that can be sharpened to waxen stakes. While inside her personal dimension, she can control nonliving objects within the area; For instance, her stake-like candles fly to attack at her will. She has absolute control of everything in her dimension ranging from her appearing out of the floor, creating a copy of Lavi to crumbling his Innocence. Outside of her dimension she has displayed Telekinetic powers.\n\nRoad's personality and home life are surprisingly normal, despite her role as a villain. She has a childlike need to be entertained at all times, usually by the Earl's parasol Lero, and forces Tyki to entertain her when Lero will not. She shows a tendency to procrastinate on schoolwork, like many children her age, and appears to be in trouble for skipping classes often. Despite her childlike tendencies, she has also shown signs of extreme sadism and seems to enjoy watching the suffering of others, including stabbing Allen through the eye, killing an Akuma subordinate for no other reason then to anger Allen, and nailing Miranda\u2019s hands to a clock while writing profanity on the wall in her blood.\n\nHer relationships with the other members of the Noah family all vary on a basis quite similar to a normal family situation; She looks up to Tyki as an older brother and is very close to him, while the twins appear to bicker with her often in a sibling-like, affectionate manner. Her relationship with Skin is unknown, as almost no interaction between the two is shown in the series. She also seems to have feelings for Allen Walker, as she kisses him upon seeing him again. Tyki finds this surprising, as the only one she kissed before was the Earl.\n\nDespite Road's young appearance, she is considered the First Child by Debit and Jasdero, which suggests that she was the first Noah to awaken in the current generation. Due to this fact, she is the only Noah capable of programming Noah's Ark, and appears to have the favoritism of the Millennium Earl. She represents Noah's \"Dreams\". Road's nationality is unknown."},{"mal_id":1425,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1425\/Ren_Honjou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/46987.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/46987.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/46987t.webp"}},"name":"Ren Honjou","name_kanji":"\u672c\u57ce \u84ee","nicknames":[],"favorites":828,"about":"Blast's former bassist, Ren is actually Trapnest's guitarist.

Nana had an image of a lotus tattooed on her upper arm in honor of him (\"Ren\" is a Japanese name for lotus). The brand of the cigarettes he originally smoked was the 'Seven Stars'.\n\nNana first met him through Nobu, who really just admired him from afar. Ren was popular around their hometown for supposedly being found as a baby in an abandoned warehouse, which he lives in to this day. He isn't ashamed of this; he actually brags about it.\n\nRen and Nana are proven to be very similar throughout the series, but they are not totally similar. Ren seems to be more open with his love for Nana, being able to ask for her back and her hand in marriage while those thoughts just made Nana want to yell at him.

He is an accomplished pianist and violinist, but is also known to be a perfectionist and highly critical of himself and others.

He also appears to have fear of being abandoned and surpassed, the former comes from being abandoned by his father as a young boy. Afraid of being abandoned, he often abandons other people instead, especially Nodame. Also he's constantly afraid of being surpassed by Nodame, trying to go even further from her, which leaves her miserable as she is trying to catch up to him. He also can be considered as insensitive."}]}
