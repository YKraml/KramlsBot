When they were little she promised that one day she would marry him. Despite liking Takashi, their relationship was at odds at the beginning of the manga due to his indecisiveness. It was then that she started dating one of his friends, Hisashi, since he wouldn't make a move. As the story progressed they ended up reconciling their relationship. She doesn't find it above herself to reprimand Takashi for acting carelessly. She worries about his well-being yet admits that his selflessness nature is one reason why she fell in love with him. Headstrong and reliable, Rei has proven to be a skilled combatant and strong asset to the group.\n\nInitially in the same year as Saeko, Rei was held back despite being an excellent student. Her father- a police detective- had been investigating the corruption behind the father of Shido, one of the teachers at her school. As a result of this he held her back purposefully. Rei bears a lasting grudge against him and feels uneven whenever he's around.\n\nAfter having escaped the high school and resting at the family mansion of Saya, she and the group are in search of their parents. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":196252,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/196252\/Xiaoshi_Cheng","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/491898.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/491898.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/491898t.webp"}},"name":"Xiaoshi Cheng","name_kanji":"\u7a0b \u5c0f\u6642","nicknames":[],"favorites":1285,"about":"Age: 21\nBirthday: April 15\nWeight: 75 kg\nHeight: 180 cm\nBlood type: B\nSkills: Basketball, Photography, Martial Arts\nDislikes: Math, Loneliness, Rain\nLikes: Photography, Games, Basketball\n\nSuperpower: Can enter the world inside a photo and possess the photographer's body, temporarily controlling their words and actions.\n\nDescription: Manager of Time Photography Studio.

Despite Jigen disliking Lupin's lust for women, to the end he remains Lupin's loyal and reliable marksman. \n\nHe can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy. He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance. His hat is also an important element to his dead shot accuracy because he uses it for aiming and target acquisition. He is also proficient in the use of many different firearms, such as machine guns, sniper rifles, and even a PTRS anti-tank rifle. Daisuke is also a skilled driver and pilot.\n\nIn the original manga series, Jigen is not always at Lupin's side but lurking in the background until needed. The anime series, however, shows Jigen as extremely loyal to Lupin and willing to partner up anytime for a given heist.\n\nJigen is noted for his quick temper; enemy and friend alike have been victim to his need to repay violence for insult. Both Lupin and Goemon have been on the receiving end of his blows in his response to their frank or comical criticism.\n\nDespite Jigen's gruff facade, he has an ironic sense of humor and genuinely enjoys participating in each caper with his partners. He is, by far, the more pragmatic of the group, with a cynical streak founded in failed romances (his luck with women runs from bad to worse, with love interests often betraying him or dying). He is always distrustful of Fujiko Mine and becomes irritated when Lupin goes along with one of her plans. Among Lupin's group, Jigen is the least apprehensive at taking human life. While he considers killing women and children taboo, he is willing to put down any age or gender who offers a life threat, such as Linda in Part 2 Episode 26.\n\nWhere Lupin and Goemon Ishikawa XIII both have unique sartorial tastes, Jigen is pure basics. His typical wardrobe is a dark grey, dark green or black business suit, along with a white or light blue colored dress shirt, a black tie, and his ever-present dark grey or black broad-brimmed fedora; the hat ranks as his most prized possession outside of his weaponry. During the third anime series, Jigen's outfit is more light colored and his hatband has a cross-hatched or grid pattern design (similar to the original manga interpretation of the character); however the black look is most applied for OVA productions and TV specials. Jigen's thick hair is typically collar-length and unevenly cut. His chin curtain beard varies from an inch to three inches long and is also unruly. A few episodes of the anime use an occasional gimmick where the character has his hat pulled forward so that only the lower half of his face is visible or, if he's without his hat, his hair will be covering his upper face and eyes. However such episodes are rare; and Jigen's face is plainly shown with or without his hat in most animated depictions.\n\nJigen is the \"big brother\" of the group, and often serves as the voice of reason to Lupin's impulsiveness, as he must because of his friendship with Lupin as well as out of sheer professionalism. However, he has long since resigned himself to having to go along with the craziest of schemes. Jigen, like the rest of the Lupin gang, is adept with disguises and can pilot virtually any motorized vehicle, including planes and tanks. He has even controlled a NASA Space Shuttle. He is also a tough hand-to-hand opponent, capable of knocking out an attacker with one blow.\n\nWhile his racial origins may be in question, Jigen was at one time a famed bodyguard and assassin for many American criminal mobs. Of several stories regarding his past, the most popular has him an American mobster who moved to Japan on the lam; there he adopted a Japanese identity and name (\"Jigen\" is the conventional Japanese word for \"dimension\", not a name). According to Lupin, Jigen's hobbies are limited due to his stay-at-home preference. When he does go out, he usually attends target practice, visits a favorite bar, plays poker, enjoys a boxing match or eats at a chop house-style restaurant. He also has a weakness for Spaghetti Westerns, lounging, classical music (except in Episodes 79 and 89 of Part 2), and hearty American food.\n\nJigen's most obvious pastime is smoking; there is hardly a time when he not seen with a cigarette, usually one bent in a number of directions. His preferred brands have been Pall Mall Filter Longs or Marlboro Red. He is also seen occasionally smoking a briar pipe. As well, Jigen enjoys drinking scotch, bourbon, vodka, beer and occasionally fine wines; he has a \"heavyweight's\" resistance to intoxication.\n\nThe Tokyo Pop releases of the original Lupin manga note in their preface that Jigen's appearance and temperament are based on the actor James Coburn, especially Coburn's role, Britt, in The Magnificent Seven. This has been confirmed by Monkey Punch during a 2003 Dallas, Texas anime convention interview. In a television documentary celebrating the manga's history, Monkey Punch stated he based the Jigen\/Lupin relationship on Alain Delon and Charles Bronson's teaming in the 1968 film Adieu l'ami.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Lupin III)"},{"mal_id":141,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/141\/Lenalee_Lee","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/40740.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/40740.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/40740t.webp"}},"name":"Lenalee Lee","name_kanji":"\u30ea\u30ca\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30ea\u30fc","nicknames":["Lena"],"favorites":1281,"about":"Height: 168 cm\nWeight: 48 kg\nAge: 16\nBirth date: February 20\nBlood type: B\nNationality: Chinese\n\nKomui's younger sister, and assistant Head Officer.

He is the son of the major general of the 7th division and is an excellent sniper.\nHe later joins Sugimotos group, but his esxact goals are unknown for a long time.\nHis favourite food is monkfish stew.\n\nPersonality: Ogata is a very cold-blooded person, who doesn't seem to trust anyone but himself. He doesn't hesitate to kill others and feels no regret or pity, which he himself points out as characteristics a sniper should have. He will remain his cool during a fight, but if his chances of winning are low, he rather escapes than jumping into a fight he can't win. Even though he is quite emotionless, he does not like to be questioned, since has his own understanding of pride. In his opinion all people have to be ruthless killers like him, or else they \"should not even exist\".\nOn the surface he seems polite, but is also able to deceive others. \n\n[spolier]Ogata is an illegitimate child and grows up with his mother, who waits miserably for his father to return, but he never does. In the course of his childhood, he poisons his mother with rat poison and hopes that his father will at least return at the funeral. When this does not happen, Ogata later murders his father as well, but this is recorded as seppuku. While the father is living out his last minutes, Ogata lectures him about wondering if he could have lived a normal life with familial love. Later, he meets his half-brother Yuusaku in the army, to whom he is rather dismissive. Later it comes out that Ogata is jealous of his happy brother Yuusaku because of his tragic family history. Ogata is very displeased that his half-brother, by being the flag bearer, does not get his hands dirty in the war and tries to corrupt him. When all his attempts fail and Yuusaku declares that he does not believe his half-brother can be so corrupt and certainly has some humanity, Ogata decides to shoot him on the battlefield from his own ranks. It is implied that Ogata ends up regretting the murders of his mother and Yuusaku.[\/spoiler]"},{"mal_id":1018,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1018\/D","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/54285.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/54285.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/54285t.webp"}},"name":"D","name_kanji":null,"nicknames":["Vampire Hunter"],"favorites":1256,"about":"D is a dhampir, the half-breed child of a vampire father the legendary Vampire lord and human mother, therefore he makes the ideal vampire hunter. He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace, but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D has surprising power and resourcefulness, possessing most of the strengths and only mild levels of vampiric weaknesses. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a \"normal\" human, though marked by his unearthly beauty and powerful aura, and thus rarely accepted by humans. His only notable weaknesses are that he is, while not unfeeling, emotionally remote but sometimes sentimental. He is also (far more rarely than other dhampirs) randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years. Otherwise, D does not suffer from vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, possessing an imposing supernatural aura to his opponents and godlike reflexes surpassing even vampires.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":37513,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/37513\/Yozora_Mikazuki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/150969.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/150969.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/150969t.webp"}},"name":"Yozora Mikazuki","name_kanji":"\u4e09\u65e5\u6708 \u591c\u7a7a","nicknames":["Sora"],"favorites":1256,"about":"Birthday: December 24th\nBlood Type: A\n\nA cruel and selfish black-haired girl who says she understands and respects bullying but resents being called a bully herself, Yozora's difficult personality drives away anyone who might wish to make friends with her before she meets Kodaka.
