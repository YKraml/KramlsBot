Of the successors, Near is the more level-headed, calmly assessing the situation, while the other, Mello, is more emotional and quick to act. Much like L, Near shows various odd behaviors during his normal life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting. He also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories, as well as idly twiddling strands of his hair. He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L's methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice. Near uses the Wedding Text font \"N\" and \"L\" to represent himself and the fake L, respectively. But later in the aftermath, he used Old English font \"L\" like the original L did. He is voiced by Noriko Hidaka in the Japanese anime, Cathy Weseluck in the English dub, and Bruno Coronel in the Latin Spanish version.\n\n\nTsugumi Ohba, writer of Death Note, said that Near \"becomes less likeable\" as the story advances, citing Near's plan to take the notebook at a later point in the story. Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from \"the difference in their attitudes\" and that people may have viewed Near as \"a cheat.\" Ohba added that Near's \"cheeky behavior,\" intended to \"reinforce his childishness,\" had been construed as \"annoying.\"\n\nIn the final chapter Near brings finger puppets to the Yellow Box Warehouse. Takeshi Obata, artist of Death Note, said that Near first bought the Kira finger puppet and drew on it with a magic marker. Obata then said that Near must have created the other puppets afterwards. Obata views Near as not liking L much so Obata had Near depict L as \"ugly\", and that Near \"worked hard\" on Mello's puppet as Near \"liked Mello.\"\n\nObata said he enjoyed drawing Near and that Near is also one of his favorite and his least favorite characters, considering him to be the smartest character in the manga \"because he cheats.\"\n\nWhen asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and \"maybe Light.\" Regarding Near, Ohba said that he does not leave his house often."},{"mal_id":13084,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/13084\/Guido_Mista","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/380304.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/380304.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/380304t.webp"}},"name":"Guido Mista","name_kanji":"\u30b0\u30a4\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30df\u30b9\u30bf","nicknames":[],"favorites":3612,"about":"Mista is one of the heroes of part 5, a part of Bruno's gang.

Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of Pain. Pain sent other Akatsuki members to recruit Deidara, though he refused. After being defeated by Itachi Uchiha, however, Deidara was forced to join the organization. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori's death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.\n\nIn battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything in a 10 kilometer radius."},{"mal_id":41182,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/41182\/Nezumi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/123009.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/123009.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/123009t.webp"}},"name":"Nezumi","name_kanji":"\u30cd\u30ba\u30df","nicknames":["Mouse","Rat","Eve"],"favorites":3585,"about":"Date of birth: unknown\nAs he is the same age as Shion he was presumably born in 2001.

Kanda has long black hair (dark blue in the anime), which the mangaka notes that he uses soap to wash. Lavi comments that Kanda is a \"pretty-type character\", and Allen occasionally calls him \"feminine face\". He also has been commented that he has \"dark eyes\" by the head of the Asian branch (9 years ago) and he has blue eyes in the manga. Kanda seems to be conceited over his hair.\n\nPersonality\n\nKanda comes across as cold, stoic, and arrogant, even to his fellow exorcists. In battle he will do anything to win, sometimes at the risk of his teammates. He once made a sarcastic joke about leaving them to die. It is his opinion that exorcists are not saviors.\n\nYuu, or Yuu, is Kanda's given name, though he dislikes being called by it or even introducing himself as such. He calls Allen \"bean sprout\" (\u30e2\u30e4\u30b7, moyashi, English Dub: \"Short Stack\"). Kanda seems to know Lavi, though he doesn't hesitate with his usual threats if Lavi calls Kanda by his given name; however, it is clear that Kanda does care for his fellow Exorcists and the Finders (whom he claims not to care about).\n\nHe tends to mask his emotions and often claims, \"It's none of my business.\" In spite of his intentions, he and Allen are often at each other's throats and rarely see eye-to-eye on anything.\n\n\nKanda's favorite foods are soba noodles and tempura (especially pumpkin, shishitou [a small, sweet green pepper], and lotus root). Kanda dislikes many things, to the point that \"there are too many to write down\"; however, Kanda himself points out that he hates people with naive personalities, people who don't keep their promises, cursed people, people who can't keep their mouths shut, people who call him by his given name, and \"sweet things\".\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nInnocence\n\n\"Mugen\" (\u516d\u5e7b,Six Illusions). Kanda has a sword with supernatural powers. He runs his index and middle finger through the back of the blade to activate it, whilst saying Mugen Unsheathe, Innocence Activate, which turns the blade silver. The Shape of the sword has changed throughout Kanda's Timeline, during his childhood, it takes the form of a small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt, upon Kanda's introduction in the beginning of the series, it took the form of a chokuto (a straight Japanese sword without a tsuba) with a black cross-emblazoned hilt and sheath, but after his battle with Skin Boric, it was reforged into a traditional Katana.\n\n\n(Source: D.Gray-Man Wikia)"},{"mal_id":143076,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/143076\/Satanichia_Kurumizawa_McDowell","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/339560.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/339560.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/339560t.webp"}},"name":"Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell","name_kanji":"\u80e1\u6843\u6ca2=\u30b5\u30bf\u30cb\u30ad\u30a2=\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30eb","nicknames":["Satania"],"favorites":3520,"about":"Birthday: August 15\nSign: Leo\nWeight: 46 kg\nHeight: 157 cm\nBWH: 85-58-84\n\nA dimwitted demon who often thinks of petty ways to cause mischief which usually end in failure.
