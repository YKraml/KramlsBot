Formerly Sherry of the Black Organization, she is on the run from them and lives with Professor Agasa. She is also one of few characters who knows Shinichi is Conan. \n\nMiyano Shiho and her older sister, Miyano Akemi, were born into the secret crime syndicate \"The Black Organization.\" Her English mother, Miyano Elena, and her Japanese father, Miyano Atsushi, were both scientists working for the Black Organization on an important secret project. While Haibara was young, both her parents died in what was claimed to be an accident. While Akemi lived a normal life, the highly intelligent Haibara was groomed to take over her parents' research. A child prodigy, she was sent to the United States for education at a very young age, and then later came back to Japan to finish her parents' secret project.\n\nShiho was unhappy that the Black Organization's was using the incomplete APTX 4869 for murder, as that was not the drug's intended purpose. When Shiho received word that her sister Akemi had been killed, but was given no explanation why, she decided to boycott her research until the Black Organization gave her an adequate explanation. Instead, the Organization confined her in a small room to await her execution. With no other way out, she took a pill of APTX 4869 to commit suicide, but instead shrank into an eight year old girl. In her new, smaller body, she escaped from the Black Organization and attempted to reach Shinichi's house, hoping he might be able to help her. Exhausted, she collapsed in front of Shinichi's house, where she was found by Professor Agasa, who took her in. In fact, as it turned out later, Agasa was acquaintances with her parents\u2014especially her father\u2014even though he didn't know at that time that they had children or were part of the Black Organization.\n\nTo prevent the knowledge of her transfiguration from being discovered, Shiho and Professor Agasa create her alias Haibara Ai. As Haibara, she attends Teitan Elementary School with Kudou Shinichi's shrunken form, Edogawa Conan. Following her first adventure with the Detective Boys in which they investigate the disappearance of a schoolmate's brother, she reveals her true identity to Conan and the fact that she had developed the APTX 4869. At first stunned, then outraged, Conan protests her presence, but as time passes, he accepts Haibara as a friend and fellow victim, though her cynicism and secretive air still rail him at times. Haibara also joins the ranks of the Detective Boys, and although she does not think too highly of her teammates' immature antics, she has come to value them all as close friends.\n\nHaibara has a calm and cool personality, sarcastic wit, and high intelligence. When freshly escaped from the Black Organization, she was cynical and pushed others away. Haibara has since defrosted by embracing her new child life and has established strong relationships with Conan, the Detective Boys, Agasa, and Ran.\n\nShe tries to keep Conan from doing reckless things that may give away their identity, though often she is surprised by his actions which usually result in gaining the information he needs while also keeping their identities secret. However, whenever Conan is reckless in regards to keeping his identity from Ran, Haibara is the one who plans ahead in order to keep him from being revealed."},{"mal_id":235,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/235\/Kimihiro_Watanuki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/471600.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/471600.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/471600t.webp"}},"name":"Kimihiro Watanuki","name_kanji":"\u56db\u6708 \u4e00\u65e5\u541b\u5c0b","nicknames":[],"favorites":2270,"about":"Birthday: April 1 \n\nWatanuki is a high school student whose life has been a rather difficult one\u2014not only have both his parents died, forcing him to live alone, but he is plagued daily by spirits that only he can see (both the ability to see them and the cause of their attacks are evidently heritable traits\u2014apparently Watanuki's blood smells very delicious to spirits). \n\nOne day, Watanuki enters into an agreement with Yuuko to work for her in exchange for the fulfillment of his wish\u2013to never see spirits again.

She is also a protagonist of Date AST Like, a spin-off manga which focuses on her relationship with Mikie in the AST, as well as the main character of Date A Origami, a 4-koma comic strip manga which focuses on the romantic comedy aspect of the main series.\n\nOrigami is a top student in her school both in terms of academics and sports. Of course, none of the student body and facility members know that she is a member of the AST with a few exceptions unknown to her. Origami is a very skilled wizard but can lose herself in her emotions when it comes to dealing with Spirits in combat. Origami is in love with Shidouu, her love for Shidouu is greatly high that she stalks him.\n\n\n\nOrigami is shown as a young female with short, silvery-white hair arranged in a bob cut with three hair-clips in the left part of her hair. She has blue eyes and wears the girl uniform like her female classmates when at school.\n\nHowever, in her AST Combat Wiring Suit, her appearance is more fierce. Origami's clips are not worn, instead a pair of sensors are attached to her hair with armor covering her from shoulder to hand as well as part of her body and legs but not thighs. Her chest is seen at the top of the transparent suit as well as revealing her belly.\n\nOrigami is a person that rarely openly talks with other people unless needed with only a few exceptions such as Shidou Itsuka and Tooka Yatogami. She isn't a shy person, but more of an unsocial type of person. She can be a bit reckless or aggressive if she has a goal or purpose to fulfill.\n\n\nAs a wizard, She was the vanguard and current \"Ace\" for the AST. Her skills as a member of the AST were noted to be quite phenomenal, as she was the only one who at first could manage to fight a spirit close quarters(although she still lost), and she was also the most extreme, hoping to kill Yoshino by first dropping a building on her dome. She managed to utilise the CR-Unit &lt;White Licorice&gt;, which is noted to be very dangerous and dificult to handle, in fact, no one else but her has proven to be capable of using it long enough to actually put it to practical use. She was even able to land a hit on the world's most powerful Wizard, Ellen, which Ellen herself considers worthy of praise.\n\n\nOrigami one-sidedly proclaims herself as Shidou's girlfriend or lover unbeknownst to Shidouu himself. Origami uses any chance she gets to make her relationship with Shidou more intimate. Her love for him is quite unhealthy as she often disregards most of Shidou's feelings or opinions and can come off as self-centered.\n\nIn reality, Origami is a stalker with Shidou being the focus of her desires. She has secretly been following Shidou around in his everyday life since before the start of the series and has on many occasions tried seducing him with her actions, such as buying a new bed, making herself deliberately vulnerable, giving him a combination of strong energy drinks and preparing traps to entice him to her. However blunt she may be, Shidou has not acknowledged or reciprocated her feelings.\n\nOrigami has also proven to value Shidou's life over her loyalty to AST and DEM, going so far as to steal a dangerous CR-Unit from them and combat them specifically to protect him. She however, does not seem to value his emotions above her revenge, as while she does try to remove him physically from her fights with Kotori and the other spirits, she makes no attempt to stop or even consider his reaction to her killing them. This is especially evident in regards to Kotori, since she is Shidou's sister, while Origami later admitted she didn't want to kill Kotori, and readily believed Shidou when he said that it was a different spirit that killed her parents, it is clear that had Shidou not told her that then she would have without regret.\n\nOrigami sees Tooka as an enemy, love rival, and an annoying \"baka\" that gets in her way with Shidou. Origami shows little respect for her as the quarrel between them as Spirit and AST member remains unsettled despite the fact that Tooka's powers are sealed. Origami does not trust her very much as she views every other Spirit but is not hostile to her due to Tooka's currently sealed status.\n\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wikia)"},{"mal_id":324,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/324\/Ryouma_Echizen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/423565.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/423565.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/423565t.webp"}},"name":"Ryouma Echizen","name_kanji":"\u8d8a\u524d \u30ea\u30e7\u30fc\u30de","nicknames":["Ochibi","Koshimae","Prince","Chibisuke","Gaki"],"favorites":2216,"about":"1st Year Student\nNicknames: Prince of Tennis, Samurai Jr., Super Rookie of the East, Super Freshman, Seigaku's Pillar of Support, Ochibi (by Kikumaru Eiji), Chibisuke (Ryoga Echizen), Brat (by Akutsu Jin), Koshimae (Kintar\u014d T\u014dyama), Tennis No Oujisama (by Keigo Atobe), Seishonen (by Nanjir\u014d Echizen), Samurai (by Ken)\nBirthdate: December 24\nZodiac: Capricorn\nClass: 1-2\nRelatives: Father- Echizen Nanjiroh; Mother- Echizen Rinko; Halfbrother- Echizen Ryoga; Cousin- Meino Nanako; Cat- Karupin\nPlaystyle: All-rounder\nDominant Hand: Left, Ambidextrous\nHeight: 151cm\nBlood Type: O\nSpecial Moves: Twist Serve, Twist Smash, Drive A, Drive B, Drive C, Drive D, Cool Drive, Cyclone Smash (anime only), Samurai Drive, One-Footed Split Step, Muga no Kyouchi\nHat: Fila\nShirt: Fila\nFavorite Shoes: Fila (Marks Philippoussis Mid)\nFavorite Racket: YonexBRIDGESTONE (DYNABEAM GRANDEA)\nFavorite Subject: Science, English\nWorst Subject: Japanese.\nCommittee: Library Committee \nFavorite Color: Silver\nFavorite Food: Egg sandwiches, Chawanmushi, Fried Fish, Japanese\nHobby: Trying new hot spring bath salts in his bath\nFather's Occupation: Helps run the temple nearby\n\n\nRyoma Echizen (\u8d8a\u524d \u30ea\u30e7\u30fc\u30de, Echizen Ry\u014dma) is the protagonist of the Prince of Tennis series.
