Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a \"cross\" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga.\n\nAce has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads \"ASCE\" with the \"S\" (apparently a mistake on the part of the tattoo artist, or, alternatively, the symbol that appeared on the flag of his old crew  crossed out. In the English version of the anime, Ace's shoulder tattoo signifying his name is edited out, as he is referred to there as \"Portgaz D. Trace.\" He appears in One Piece Grand Adventure, once again without the tattoo on his arm.\n\nAce travels around the Grand Line on his boat which is constructed so his Mera Mera no Mi fuels the engine on the rear end allowing it to move.\n\nCurrently, Ace is one of the two known pirates to ever escape arrest by the Marine captain Smoker, the other escapee being Ace's younger brother Luffy. Ace and Smoker fought to a standstill in Alabasta.\n\nHe left Fuusha Village three years before Luffy, and he is a loyal crewman and commands the Second Division of Whitebeard, his captain.\n\nIn appearance, the two brothers are obviously related, despite the fact that Ace is more muscular than the rather lanky Luffy. He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother.\n\nIt is revealed that Ace had a bounty of 550,000,000 in the One Piece Ten exhibition.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":68315,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/68315\/Shinya_Kougami","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/458989.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/458989.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/458989t.webp"}},"name":"Shinya Kougami","name_kanji":"\u72e1\u565b \u614e\u4e5f","nicknames":["Kou"],"favorites":10281,"about":"Age: 28\nBirthday: August 16, 2084\n\nShinya Kougami is an enforcement officer who is tasked with managing crime.

Inspired by his police officer grandfather's (on his mother's side) sense of justice, he isn't afraid to fight for those in need.

The easiest way to do that is to mock his hair, which makes Jousuke angry and explosively violent. Jousuke grew up with his single mother, never knowing his father Joseph Joestar. Jousuke is crafty and has a sneaky streak for money, which is shown multiple times in the story. Nevertheless, he is a dependable and friendly person who is always willing to protect people who need it.\n\nJousuke's Stand power, Crazy Diamond, is a melee Stand with short range (2m). Crazy Diamond has the ability of \"restoration.\" It can repair damage (by returning an object to a previous state) and by extension heal injuries (apart from Jousuke's own injuries). It is limited in that it cannot revive the dead. It can, however, restore an item to its raw materials (e.g., a table can be restored to timbers). This ability allows Crazy Diamond to perform a range of interesting feats, including trapping the enemy (by restoring pieces of a broken crate around the target) and tracking (e.g., restoring a torn piece of clothing so that it will seek out what it came from and reattach). Its restoration ability often \"malfunctions\" when Jousuke is angry, causing the object to be improperly put back together. The Stand's name is a reference to Pink Floyd's song, \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond.\""},{"mal_id":122211,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/122211\/Nao_Tomori","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/288020.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/288020.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/288020t.webp"}},"name":"Nao Tomori","name_kanji":"\u53cb\u5229 \u5948\u7dd2","nicknames":[],"favorites":9644,"about":"Age: 15\nBirthday: Not official \n\nNao is a first-year student and also the student council president of Hoshinoumi Academy.

He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed \"Nyanko-sensei\" (or simply \"sensei\"), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.\n\nOrphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a \"liar\" and \"attention seeker\" for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively \"normal\" life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.\n\nNatsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.\n \nTo return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process."},{"mal_id":170329,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/170329\/Yor_Forger","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/457934.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/457934.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/457934t.webp"}},"name":"Yor Forger","name_kanji":"\u30e8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc","nicknames":["Thorn Princess"],"favorites":9471,"about":"Age: 27\n\nYor Forger is one of three main characters of the Spy x Family series.
