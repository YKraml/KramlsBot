Friend of Akihisa from 1st year.\n\nHideyoshi is one of the rare people with normal minds in Class F, but because of that he is often pressured by his classmates. According to his grandpa, Hideyoshi is an owner of an unbelievable beauty, so much that he is often called a girl\u2015but really, he is a fine man. His loveliness even nominated him in the list of 'Guys who would look good in girl's outfit', sponsored by the Journalism club, but he was eventually dropped from the ranking for being 'unfair'. Because of his appearance, girls often forget his real gender, leaving Akihisa as the only one who recognizes him as a guy (though sometimes even Akihisa forgets this). In training camps, for the safety of his own and the others, he is given a private separate dressing room and bathroom. In school, there is a rumor that Hideyoshi is actually of the 3rd gender, dubbed \"Hideyoshi\". As with Akihisa's case, Hideyoshi's photos are secretly sold and bought\u2015the price of his photo being 5 times higher than photos of Akihisa in girl outfits. He feels regretful for not being treated as a guy by many. However, given that he blushes his face when treated as a girl by Akihisa, delights when called a fool's friend, puts in tackles that are subtly off the point\u2015it seems he doesn't hate it so much either. Therefore, this person is also not exactly normal.\n\nHe takes part in the Drama club and his speciality is vocal mimicry\u2015be that a girl's or a boy's voice. Even though he is often not too willing to act, once a situation occurs, he perfectly deals with his given role, thanks to his excessive drama spirit. Part of the reason why he is in Class F is because he too absorbed into drama and couldn't keep up the grades. It seems he is especially weak in Classic Literature.\n\nIn contrast to his lovely outlook, he has an extremely strong stomach ('Steel Stomach' as called by himself) that can even take in a potato seed. However, even such stomach cannot stand against Mizuki's mighty lunch. \n\nHis name originates from 'Toyotomi Hideyoshi' and his old name 'Kinoshita Toukichirou'.\n\nHis shoukanjuu (summoned beast)'s equipments are blue pants and Naginata. Occult version is Nekomata (ghost cat girl), obviously influenced from the nature 'Cuteness'.\n\nHideyoshi is ranked 1st in Male Characters and 10th in Female Characters of the 2009 version of \"Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!

She and Irina formed a temporary alliance with Issei, Koneko, Yuuto, and Saji, in which they would retrieve the stolen Excaliburs fragments but would allow Yuuto to destroy one of them. During the fight with Freed Sellzen and Valper Galilei, she reveals herself to be the wielder of Durandal, and quickly turns the tide of battle by destroying the fused Excalibur and cutting down Freed. Following the battle with the Fallen Angel leader Kokabiel, she became a Devil under Rias after finding out that God died.\n\nWhen Xenovia was first introduced, she was portrayed as an individual with a quiet and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She also prefers not to get involved in problems that do not concern her. While a faithful member of the Church, her beliefs are flexible enough to accept help from a Dragon such as receiving a free lunch (after Irina spent all their money on a fake painting of a Saint), and wanting to not only accomplish their mission, but survive afterwards as well. After Volume 3, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they previously met. Like Asia, as a person who was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school.\n\nAs a Knight, Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds, which, combined with the destructive powers of Durandal, makes her a formidable fighter. She also has the ability to tap into Durandal's holy aura with other swords, evident when she uses it with Issei's Ascalon (Issei allows her to use it since he is not a good swordsman and because she cannot fully control Durandal).\n\n\n\n(Source: High School DxD Wikia)"},{"mal_id":5060,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/5060\/Puck","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/101984.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/101984.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/101984t.webp"}},"name":"Puck","name_kanji":"\u30d1\u30c3\u30af","nicknames":[],"favorites":1445,"about":"A wind spirit from Elfhelm, a utopia on the island Skellig in the Western Sea.

As a kid he was quite violent, and grew up to be a pirate. However, he's hung up his pirate hat and has gone from being a swashbuckling bad boy to a self-proclaimed \"gentleman.\"\n\nSince long ago, he's been on bad terms with France. Both have done terrible things to one another, the most notable in the Hetalia series (on England's part) being when England's army burned Jeanne d'Arc at the stake. A teenage France used to pick on a young England back in the day, but their little squabbles and arguments (even in present times) are usually and have been over extremely petty issues. Despite this, they seem to have an underlying respect for one another and spend every Christmas together as shown in the comics. England also allowed France to 'conquer him when they thought the world was ending, something which France had always dreamed of. They are also shown to be quite close to each other, even if they do bicker often, France being one of the Englishman's closest friends (even if he'll deny it.)\n\nHe raised America as a child after fighting over him with France and Finland. The two were like brothers, but England insisted that America not refer to him as such (the unpleasant memories of his own brothers haunted him). Due to America declaring his independence and fighting against him, their relationship was spoiled. Apparently, on every 4th of July (America's Independence Day) since then, he becomes ill and heartbroken. In present times, the two are always butting heads over something, but deep down, they both care for each other.\n\nAlthough America was like a brother to him, he does have actual blood brothers; Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who have yet to be profiled, were mentioned to hate his guts, going so far as to throw rocks at him, mail curses to him, and shoot arrows at him to keep him away from them. His youngest brother is Sealand, who also seems to hate him, calling him \"Jerk England.\" Even so, England does care for him (though is usually annoyed and frustrated with him and his antics).\n\nHis personality is rather cynical, stubborn, sarcastic, competitive, and cold, even though he claims to be a gentleman. He has a sharp tongue and a potty mouth, but is not a bad person. He's also described as being a tsundere. When he becomes friends with someone, he is surprisingly very loyal to them. France noted him once as having a slender build. England has a strong belief in the supernatural and the occult; he can even perform black magic, see supernatural creatures, and is able to converse with said creatures (such as unicorns, ghosts, fairies, and even on some accounts, a flying bunny and Captain Hook). However, he refuses to believe in aliens. His hobbies include embroidery and other craftsmanship, drinking tea, getting drunk, literature, rock\/punk music, and criticizing America's movies. He also loves to cook, but a running gag throughout the entire series is that he sucks at it and that his food has no taste whatsoever (which is why America, who grew up eating his food, is able to eat the strange \"delicacies\" that he does). When drunk, he becomes violent and bitter, often complaining or raving on about America in his drunken state.\n\nHis most noticeable feature are his thick, bushy eyebrows. During his pirate days, he used to set up colonies everywhere (and torment the heck out of Spain). It appears as though all of his colonies (that have been personified so far) possess the same bushy eyebrows (examples being Hong Kong, Wy, and Australia).\n\nAlthough he officially represents the United Kingdom as a whole, among his brothers Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, he is supposed to represent England. Through the Hetalia series, he's also referred to as \"England\" on numerous accounts (even though Hidekaz Himaruya stated that to the other countries of the world, he is simply \"United Kingdom\"), which most of the general fandom is familiar with. The English dubbed version of the anime adaptation refers to him as \"Britain,\" something that, according to the company, was a request from the original Japanese producers."},{"mal_id":167031,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/167031\/Hana_Uzaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/371829.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/371829.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/371829t.webp"}},"name":"Hana Uzaki","name_kanji":"\u5b87\u5d0e \u82b1","nicknames":[],"favorites":1419,"about":"Age: 19\nHeight: 150 cm (4'11)\nBust Size: 96 cm (J in JP)\n\nHana Uzaki is confident, cheerful, and energetic, and loves teasing her senpai, Shinichi Sakurai.
