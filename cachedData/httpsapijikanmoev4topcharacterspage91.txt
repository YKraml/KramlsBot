She was leading a simple life until a series of misfortunes got her involved with the Akudama.

She is very compassionate and will do what is right, even when this will put her in harm's way. This however, makes her somewhat naive around certain aspects of the corrupted world of Akudama. She cannot understand why criminals can hurt others without hesitation and what motivates them. She can be spontaneous and gets flustered in high pressure situations.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Swindler is a young woman with a youthful appearance who wears a pink and white stripe dress with black long finger-less gloves that reaches above her elbows, a blue bracelet on her right wrist and pink shoes that is paired with black thigh-high socks. She has shoulder length black hair that appears to subtly curve outwards and pink streaks on her bangs.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nAlthough she is initially involved in the Black Cat's mission without her consent, Swindler is shown to use quick-thinking to succeed despite panicking, and to be a risk-taker. As time goes on, Swindler gets used to being involved in dangerous situations and makes use of her newfound abilities in order to survive and protect  Sister despite not being a trained fighter.\n\n(Source: Akudama Drive Wiki)"},{"mal_id":46989,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/46989\/Koto","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/276022.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/276022.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/276022t.webp"}},"name":"Koto","name_kanji":"\u30b3\u30c8","nicknames":[],"favorites":533,"about":"A strange, 14-year-old girl who stumbled into the City Through the Looking Glass.

He has black hair, which has been colored dark brown in most of the original manga illustrations, and brown soulless eyes.\n\nWhen he first became a nation many years ago, he was taken in and raised by China, who considered him as a younger brother. When asked if they were related, Japan denied all connections with China. Japan eventually grew hostile towards China and attacked him with a katana one night, ruining their relationship and thus making them enemies in war. Today, China still seems to care about Japan, even though Japan shows no interest in him whatsoever.\n\nJapan seems to get along quite well with various countries, such as America, England, Greece, Turkey, the Netherlands, and others. In return, these countries watch out for him at times. Hidekaz Himaruya also stated that, even though Japan has never really been shown together with them, he would also get along well with Romano and Prussia, addressing them as \"Romano-kun\" and \"Prussia-kun\" (instead of using the typical and respectful honorific \"san\").\n\nOn the other hand, Japan and Russia do not get along so soundly. In the past, Russia cursed Japan, and in present day, just by looking at him, Russia can give Japan a stomachache. When Japan learned that Germany was making an alliance with Russia, Japan expressed dismay and went so far as to try various methods of killing Russia, such as hiding in Germany\u2019s ceiling when Russia came in order to harpoon him. Japan\u2019s philosophy about Russia that, \"That man is a monster created by fallout from nuclear tests! He tears down buildings! He breathes fire!\"\n\nHe\u2019s known as being serious, quiet, mysterious, and shy, but prudish, hard-working, intelligent, and skilled with his hands. His catchphrases are \"I will consider it,\" \"Maybe next time,\" and \"My answer is always \u2018no.\u2019 \" Despite how usually calm he is, his anger is said to be extremely frightening, but just about no one has ever witnessed it due to the fact that he doesn\u2019t get angry very easily. Because he was a shut-in for so many years, he doesn\u2019t know much about the outside world, but is always eager and makes an effort to learn. He\u2019s described as acting like an old man or an otaku on several occasions. He actually revealed to Greece, England, and France once that he prefers 2D girls rather than 3D, real life women. Japan seems to love animals, seeing as how he has a pet dog (named \"Pochi-kun\"), a guinea pig, and a rabbit. It seems as though he has a weakness for meat buns and soft, fluffy things, but absolutely detests cockroaches to the point where he would cry. His hobbies include watching the seasons change, watching the moon, and creating new forms of technology. Hidekaz Himaruya revealed that his blood type is most likely A positive, the most common blood type in Japan.\n\nMost people would look at his unique culture as being strange or mysterious, but he finds it perfectly normal and couldn\u2019t see it as anything else. Japan can\u2019t really comprehend Western culture, and is utterly appalled at \"Western nudity,\" even though it was shown that he has erotic woodblock prints in his possession.\n\nAlso to note is that his first name, \"Kiku,\" means \"chrysanthemum\" in Japanese. His last name \"Honda\" (\u672c\u7530), is written with the same kanji for \"hon\" (\u672c) as in \"Nihon\" (\u65e5\u672c), which means \"Japan\" in Japanese."},{"mal_id":4700,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/4700\/Boota","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/67375.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/67375.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/67375t.webp"}},"name":"Boota","name_kanji":"\u30d6\u30fc\u30bf","nicknames":[],"favorites":527,"about":"Simon's sidekick.
