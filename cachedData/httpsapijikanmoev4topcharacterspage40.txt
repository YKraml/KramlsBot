While she wishes she could spend her time with Shio forever in their apartment, she is aware of the fact that they cannot live on peacefully if she does not work and earn money for food, utilities, etc. Because of this, Satou often has to confront the outside world where people interfere with her relationship due to her past history of accepting anyone who has confessed to her and changing partners every three days. Satou is prone to severe animosity when people disrupt her relationship with their interpretation of \"love,\" and can be easily provoked when it comes to Shio due to her overprotectiveness.

Morita is unable to graduate, as he can never wake up on time to go to classes. This is mainly due to the work that he does, which forces him to go missing for periods of time. What he does for work though remains a mystery. When Morita comes back from his mysterious job, he immediately falls asleep for at least 48 hours, due to the amount of work he does. He also returns with a large sum of money in his back-pocket and brings a food item to share with his flat mates. Although the flat mates believe he does it to mock them, such as when he brings a bag of croquettes instead of meat, Morita does care deeply for his friends such as Takemoto.\n\nMorita is a very mysterious person. He does many random, crazy things for his personal enjoyment, such as creating a twister game with too many colors, which resulted in horrific pain for him and Takemoto. Morita is a perceptive individual, but tactless and often states the truth, such as how Mayama secretly stalks Rika outside her apartment, when nobody wants to hear it. He also expresses his love for Hagu in weird and quirky ways, such as forcing Hagu to dress up as a mouse.

Little is known about the strange, large foreigner who has been with Motoko Kusanagi for years.  He was once American and served in the Special Forces in South America.  His amount of cyborg-ization is variable according to the storyline, from his limbs only up to most of his body, second only to the Major herself.  Despite the availability of superior eyes, he grew superstitious about his old-style eye replacements, popular with many high-level military operatives.  He also retains some residual body-image issues, causing him to continually purchase workout equipment despite the obvious anachronism.\n\nIn the two Stand Alone Complex series, Batou's personality is more like that in the manga version. He is an outgoing joker, but one with a quick temper. Being emotional and not as calm as the Major, Batou shows anger at injustice and cruelty, to the point of seeming downright hotheaded at times. He sometimes shows impatience with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa, to the point of rudeness, and jokes with him constantly.\n\nAt times, he is also shown to be a voice of reason and concern for the Major, to the point that she admits she can confide in him. Both seasons of the anime, like the movies, hint at some romantic tension between the two, particularly near the end of each Gig. This tension is touched upon, briefly, in the Solid State Society movie, where Batou admits that he's been covering up any of the Major's appearances in cases prior to the Puppet Master case.\n\nBatou had served in a military special forces team before entering Section 9. Most of his body is comprised of cybernetic prosthetics. Despite the fact that exercise will do his cybernetic body parts no benefits, Batou lifts weights as a hobby. Based on several of the Stand Alone Complex episodes, Batou seems to have served in the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force at some point before he joined Section 9. It is suggested several times that he held a JGSDF Ranger qualification. His unit was involved in World War IV and was deployed to South America alongside Motoko Kusanagi, where they accidentally stumbled across an American Imperial Navy unit conducting a covert operation codenamed \"Project Sunset,\" which consisted of soldiers earning the trust of communities and then carrying out war crimes, spreading terror and chaos in the enemy ranks. Batou's eyes are grey and clearly prosthetic. They are standard cybernetic equipment issued to Ranger Special Forces operatives."},{"mal_id":4835,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/4835\/Lum","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/498938.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/498938.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/498938t.webp"}},"name":"Lum","name_kanji":"\u30e9\u30e0","nicknames":["The Invader","Lamu","Lam\u00f9"],"favorites":1675,"about":"Lum (also referred to in English dubs as Lam\u00f9) is a beautiful Oni alien who is capable of flying and generating electrical shocks.\n\nShe is extremely popular and is famous for ending her sentences with ~datcha (loosely translated as \"yes?\" or \"you know?\").\n\nExcept when in her school girl's uniform, she usually wears a sexy outfit consisting of a tiger-striped bikini and knee-high go-go boots.\n\nWhile generally good-natured, sweet, and innocent, Lum also has a very hot temper.

Mihawk is so strong, in fact, he is accused by some characters (and fans) of having the power of a Devil Fruit; however, nothing has stated anything but that his abilities simply come from pure skill and power.\n\nHe wields the Black Sword Yoru, the strongest sword in the world. It's an ornately decorated, man-sized (6 feet) sword shaped like a cross with a shiny black blade, curved at the end. It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck.\n\nIn appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword. He is easily compared to the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts, AKA Black Bart, who also donned a crimson overcoat, a wide brimmed hat with a red feather, and a diamond cross attached to a gold chain around his neck. Mihawk travels around in a coffin-shaped raft with two green-flamed candles, a single black sail, and a single seat. The fact that he can traverse across the unforgiving oceans, as well as the Grand Line itself, in such a meager craft is yet another testament to his abilities.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":6100,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/6100\/Kei_Takishima","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/38866.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/38866.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/38866t.webp"}},"name":"Kei Takishima","name_kanji":"\u6edd\u5cf6 \u5f57","nicknames":[],"favorites":1649,"about":"Kei is always a smooth winner, he's rarely seen stressed out or concerned unless it involves Hikari in trouble.

He excells at all subject from academics to athletics to martial arts. He usually prefers to do things on his own, until Hikari shows him how much fun it can be to work together with other people. \n\nHe is first in 10th grade for best grades. He is in love with Hikari, but she is too dense to notice it. Although he doesn't come straight out and admit it, it is common knowledge among the SA that he loves her, and Kei himself also doesn't deny it. The reason he hasn't confessed his love to her or asked her out is because he figured, knowing her, she'd probably just laugh it off (yes, for all her intellectual excellence, she is quite stupid\/naive\/innocent when it comes to love). \n\nAlthough he is stoic most of the time and always keeps a calm facade under any circumstance, things involving Hikari are the only ones that bring out intense anxiety within him. It bothers him whenever Hikari pushes herself too hard, although it is for this very reason that he admires and respects her. \n\nHis birthday is on November 22nd.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":7374,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/7374\/Kraft_Lawrence","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/165537.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/165537.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/165537t.webp"}},"name":"Kraft Lawrence","name_kanji":"\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u30fb\u30ed\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9","nicknames":[],"favorites":1647,"about":"Age: 25\nHeight: 178 cm (5' 10'')\nWeight: 60 kg\n\nKraft Lawrence, who chiefly goes by his surname, is a twenty-five-year-old traveling peddler who goes from town to town buying and selling various things in order to make a living.
