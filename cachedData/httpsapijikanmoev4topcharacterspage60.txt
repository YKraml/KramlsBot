He is oblivious and dense when it comes to love and feelings himself, especially those of Sakura. He is so oblivious and dense to the point that he appears silly at times, doing absurd things such as trying on a girl's sailor uniform for research. Despite him being oblivious to Sakura's crush on him, he enjoys her presence and is often seen both around and outside of school with her.\n\nHe is a manga artist under the pen name Sakiko Yumeno, the creator of the shoujo manga \"Let's Fall in Love\".

Jones\nHeight: 177cm (5\u201910\")\nAge: 19 (appearance)\n\nA young nation who was once called the \"New World,\" America is the self-proclaimed leader of the Allies. He has blue eyes and short blonde hair, which was changed to a light brownish-blonde color in the anime adaptation.\n\nDuring his early childhood, he was fought over by France, England, and Finland, a fight which England ended up winning. America was raised by England, and the two had a brotherly relationship, all which went bad after the American Revolution. In modern times, they get along, but are often found bickering with each other or teasing each other. Even though they appear to hate each other at times, they both really care for one another\u2019s wellbeing, and England is really one of the only true friends that America has.\n\nAnother good pal of America\u2019s is Japan, who is also said to be one of America\u2019s \"true friends.\" The two often play videogames and watch movies together, and collaborate to create new technology and cars. America seems to be fond of Japan\u2019s culture, lifestyle, and home, going so far as to get excited after seeing the Tokyo Tower and an average neighborhood shrine. Japan is often puzzled by America\u2019s \"Western Culture\" and was shown taking pictures of his \"strangely colored\" cakes before.\n\nAmerica also has a friend named Tony, who is an alien from outer space. Even though he interacts with aliens, America can\u2019t see fairies, spirits, or other mystical creatures like England can. It was shown, however, that he is able to see them on Halloween, but no other day in the year.\n\nIt was confirmed that America and Canada are blood-brothers, though it was not stated who was older or whether they are twins or not (a common fan-speculation). Countries, such as Cuba, often mistake Canada for America due to their extremely similar appearance. On some occasions, America completely forgets about Canada\u2019s existence, has no interest in him, and overshadows him, much to Canada\u2019s chagrin. Canada usually becomes furious on the inside because of how he is treated by America, but even so, the two seem to get along with each other alright and have a normal sibling relationship.\n\nMost know him for his energetic, cheery, and somewhat hyper personality. He\u2019s rather nosy, impulsive, and cannot \"read the atmosphere\" (though it was said that he can \"assess the situation\"), so some nations often get annoyed and disgusted with him. Maybe it\u2019s because of this that Japan and England are his only real friends. His hobbies include archaeology, sports, sketching, games, making movies (especially scary ones), and eating fast food, such as hamburgers. Currently, he\u2019s obsessed with heroes, justice, freedom, strange diets, and weight-loss machines. America is noted as being deathly afraid of horror movies (that he loves, even though they scare him), ghosts, and marmite, and he believes that one can travel to any country around the world by car. He seems to have super, inhuman strength; he was able to swing a buffalo around as a child, he once stopped a car with the heel of his foot, and he once dragged England\u2019s heavy Rolls Royce around for one hour. It was because of England\u2019s cooking (that had no taste whatsoever) that nowadays, America can eat strange colored and inedible looking foods.\n\nThe small ahoge that sticks up on the right side of his head (by his part) was confirmed to represent the island of Nantucket. His glasses were said to represent Texas. In the manga, his signature bomber jacket is shown having a \"50\" embroidered on the back, representing the fifty states (in the anime, the \"50\" was removed).\n\nEven though he wears glasses, doesn't actually have a problem with his sight.\n\nHidekaz Himaruya once mentioned that the \"F.\" in his human name possibly stands for \"Franklin,\" \"Foster,\" or \"Fuck.\""},{"mal_id":153565,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/153565\/Moriko_Morioka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/356076.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/356076.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/356076t.webp"}},"name":"Moriko Morioka","name_kanji":"\u76db\u5ca1 \u68ee\u5b50","nicknames":["Morimori-chan"],"favorites":962,"about":"She has quit the company she's been working on since high school and turned into a 30-year-old single NEET.

But despite his strength, he adheres to a principle of pacifism and often refuses to outright kill his opponents, also he has sworn to never kill a human again and adheres to that promise regardless of how hard it gets for him to do so. Abel is shown in flashbacks to have a hatred for humanity, but at some point that changes into his current pacifistic and peaceful outlook on life. He acknowledges having greatly sinned at some point in his life, though it is unclear as to what sin he committed, and much of his current personality is based on retribution for his sins. Abel has at one point referred to his Crusnik form as \"a mark of his sins\", though it is unknown what he meant by that. He has feelings towards Esther Blanchett, though they are more related to her similarities with a woman from his past. In his human form he fights with a gun that shoots silver bullets.

He was adopted into the Itsuka family when he was \"abandoned\" by his mother. He possesses a strange power that allows him to seal the powers of a Spirit in his body with a kiss; however, the seal will only work if the Spirit holds enough trust or affection toward him to allow it. Although considering trust and affection is a two-way street he probably needs to have a certain amount of affection too, or at least genuinely want to help the spirit from the bottom of his heart which he usually does even before seeking out a spirit.\n\nDue to this power which was already known by Kotori Itsuka he was recruited\u2014or rather forced\u2014to join \"Ratatoskr\" to help and save Spirits. Instead of killing Spirits to prevent spacequake from happening, he has to seal the Spirit's powers with a kiss in order for them to co-exist with humans.\n\n\n\nAn average teenage boy that originally had no interests in the opposite gender until he got forced to be by his little sister. Basically, he has to deal with females on a constant basis, which he is not used to. Shido is also a very kind-hearted person, and can sympathize with others; these traits are what caused most of the Spirits to fall in love with him, as the thing they seem to lack most of all has always been a person who can do exactly this: i.e. accept and understand them. Even Miku, who treated everyone like puppets, ended up changing her world view because of him.\n\n\nShido has the mysterious, and unique ability to seal the powers of the Spirits into his own body, which was first discovered sometime in the past when Kotori was turned into a Spirit. To use his ability to seal a Spirit\u2019s power, the Spirit in question must meet a certain condition or requirement. Those conditions or requirements are that, the Spirit in question must show affection, trust, closeness, and\/or intimacy towards Shidou. Once these conditions of affection are high enough between Shidou and the Spirit in question, he can seal their power by kissing them on the lips.\n\nDepending on the Spirit itself and how much power they originally had, Shidou can either seal a majority of their power or all of it. Shidou can also \u201cborrow\u201d the power of a Spirit he sealed, but it depends on how close or intimate he is with that Spirit. This explains the nature of his regenerative abilities. However, it seems that using a Spirit's power (other than regeneration) taxes his body with great pain.\n\n\nA (seemingly) normal sibling relationship, Shidou deeply cares about Kotori (as a big brother) to the point that, he believed a fake promise made by Kotori which is no matter what happens, even if there's a spacequake, she will wait for him at the family restaurant.  \n\nShido shares an especially close bond with Tohka that goes beyond the level of mere friendship.  He was the one who gave Tohka her name, based on the day of their first meeting, April 10th.  Shido cares very deeply for Tohka, as shown on many occasions, always going out of his way to make her happy and teach her the ways of the world.  In fact, his feelings of caring towards Tohka is so strong that, when she was captured by DEM, Shido prioritized saving her above all else, despite the grave risks involved and the enormity of the odds stacked against him.\n\n\nReine Murasame: Shido treats Reine like a normal person, although he often tries to correct her when she gets his name wrong. Compared to the rest of the Fraxinus' crew, Shido has a much easier time communicating with Reine, despite her habit of getting his name wrong.\n\nYoshino: Shidou is Yoshino's new hero, savior, and the next person she depends on besides Yoshinon. Yoshino respects Shidou a lot and looks up to him as a little sister would look up to an older brother. Yoshino trusts Shidou greatly and is grateful for him in finding Yoshinon. This trust is what allowed Shido to seal her powers.\n\nKurumi Tokisaki: The first time Shidou met Kurumi she immediately revealed herself to be a Spirit and attracted his attention. During their first date, he learned she was also the first Spirit he'd ever dealt with who was actively on the offensive. After witnessing Tokisaki kill someone mercilessly, Shidou was left horrified and conflicted, unable to think of what to do until Tohka explained to him that in the end any Spirit, like her, could've become like Kurumi if they had been left alone. He thus resolves to save her, despite being terrified of her and knowing that she intends to eat him.  Later on, Shidou was even willing to team up with Kurumi in order to save Tohka from DEM.\n\nTo date she is the only spirit he has failed to seal, however, she has indeed fallen for him, arguably before he even started to date her, and is something of a Yandere towards him. She is also very teasing, especially after she witnesses Shidou having to dress up as a girl to deal with the Spirit, Miku, and openly jokes about it, much to his dismay.\n\nMiku Izayoi: At first, Miku hated Shidou, but only because of his gender, as she hates men in general due to an event that happened to her in the past. Despite this, Shidou still cares for her and is willing to help Miku overcome her hate for men, even going as far as crossdressing in order to just be able to speak to her. Shidou also did the dangerous act of stopping her berserk state, and also protected her from several grave assaults.\n\nFriends, acquaintances, and\/or classmates, depending on which one he talks to. But overall, he usually has a mundane or normal relationship with any of his classmates. After Tohka and Origami began competing over Shido, however, many of his male classmates became very jealous of him.\n\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wikia)"},{"mal_id":8041,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/8041\/Riko_Suminoe","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/76435.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/76435.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/76435t.webp"}},"name":"Riko Suminoe","name_kanji":"\u4f4f\u4e4b\u6c5f \u308a\u3053","nicknames":[],"favorites":959,"about":"Birthday: November 7\nWeight: 38.33 KG (OVA 7)\nHeight: 145 cm \n\nRiko is the younger twin sister.

She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Bleach Official Character Book Souls)"},{"mal_id":740,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/740\/Nana","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/81735.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/81735.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/81735t.webp"}},"name":"Nana","name_kanji":"\u30ca\u30ca","nicknames":["Number 7"],"favorites":958,"about":"Also known as Number 7, she is a young Silpelit girl who has the physical appearance of being 12-14 years old (though because Silpelits age rapidly, she is actually only about 6 years old). Her name, 'Nana', is Japanese for the number seven, the number by which she was called at the research facility (\"Nana\" is also a fairly common female name in Japan). Most diclonius babies are euthanized at birth in sweeps of hospital maternity wards, but Nana was one of a handful kept alive for use as a test subjects; as a result she has spent her entire life in the diclonius research facility. Kurama sees her as his daughter and cares very much for her. In an attempt to recapture Lucy, Kurama sent out Nana to find her (diclonii can telepathically sense each other), then retreat until Kurama could arrive with soldiers, but Nana wanted to impress Kurama so she tried to capture Lucy herself. Lucy and Nana engaged in a brutal telekinetic battle that ended with Lucy tearing all of Nana's limbs off. Kurama personally came to stop Lucy and save Nana, then also disregarded Director General Kakuzawa's order to kill her by giving her new prosthetic limbs and setting her free with a lot of money. Unlike many other Diclonius, because Kurama treated her with kindness, she is not homicidal or sadistic. She has the ability to temporarily disable other Diclonius' vectors by having her vectors go through their pineal gland. Although her vector power is slightly superior to Lucy's in terms of range (3 meters to Lucy's 2)and certain abilities, she lacks Lucy's sheer strength (Lucy can lift and throw many more heavy objects than Nana can), and violent nature: Nana's empathy for others does not allow her to fight as vigorously, and she loses her arms and legs when she is viciously dismembered by Lucy. With her vector arms, she is later able to manipulate prosthetic appendages and even throw them like a rocket punch.\n\nNana can be seen as the exact opposite of Lucy. While Lucy's default personality is serious and cold, Nana's is friendly and kind; Lucy's split personality \"Nyu\" is similar to Nana's default while Nana sometimes goes into trances and acts cold like Lucy's default personality. Nana is in the middle of the spectrum of Lucy's split personalities: she's not as mature as Lucy, but more mature than Nyu.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":87201,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/87201\/Jesus_Christ","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/317501.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/317501.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/317501t.webp"}},"name":"Jesus Christ","name_kanji":null,"nicknames":[],"favorites":957,"about":"According to the story told in the manga, after Jesus' resurrection, he thanked Joseph of Arimathea for the care of his body and stated that he would travel to the east.

Making a ship with the help of the locals, he set off across the sea to what would be known as America, where he lived, aged, and was finally put to rest. He seemed to have at least partial connection with the natives, who stated prior to his deathbed that they wished to see him. Shortly after his death, a large earthquake tore the ground apart, dividing his corpse by the movement of sand and relocating it to the different areas of America that would become the nine locations on Joseph of Arimathea's map.\n\n(Source: JJBA Wiki)\n\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.

The name \"Sai\" is given to him for the purposes of joining the team, his actual name being unknown. He was recruited at a young age by Root, which trained him to have no emotions so as to make it easier for him to accomplish missions. This lack of personality causes Sai to meet with hardship upon joining Team 7, as he makes the mistake of insulting the other members in an attempt to seem sociable. He tries to seem more caring by smiling, though his teammates come to dislike it due to his obvious insincerity. After spending more time with his team Sai comes to appreciate bonds, particularly the bond that exists between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha. Wanting to experience bonds for himself, Sai sets out to make as many bonds as he can. His initial attempts consist of giving people pet names, though his habit of calling people as he sees them (\"fat\", \"ugly\", etc.) finds little success. Realizing that people dislike hearing how they actually look, Sai begins to say the opposite of how he sees them, such as calling Ino Yamanaka \"beautiful\". With names proving successful, Sai has since made attempts to be helpful to others, though his attempts have thus far been unwanted by those he is trying to help.\n\nSai is a talented artist, and claims to have drawn thousands of pictures. Despite the magnitude of pictures he has drawn, his lack of emotion makes it impossible for him be inspired to give something a title, and thus all of his works are nameless. Sai's drawing ability is also the source of his jutsu; by drawing things with a brush on his scroll he is able to bring his creations to life, giving them an increased size and the ability to move. His Super Beasts Imitation Picture (\u8d85\u7363\u507d\u753b, Ch\u014dj\u016b Giga) allows him to create birds that he can use for flight and lion-like creatures that he can use for attack. Likewise, by creating an Ink Clone (\u58a8\u5206\u8eab, Sumi Bunshin?) of himself, he can perform a reconnaissance of an area without actually endangering himself. Sai can also transform words he writes on his scroll into small animals that seek out their target and revert back to words upon arriving, giving Sai an easy way to communicate."},{"mal_id":65871,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/65871\/Shinka_Nibutani","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/254697.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/254697.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/254697t.webp"}},"name":"Shinka Nibutani","name_kanji":"\u4e39\u751f\u8c37 \u68ee\u590f","nicknames":["Mori Summer","Nibu","Forest Summer"],"favorites":956,"about":"Birthday: August 30\nBlood Type: B\nWeight: 57 kg\nHeight: 165 cm\nBWH: 86-57-83\n\nA beautiful girl in Yuuta's class.
