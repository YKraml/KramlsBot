She is responsible for turning Mikaela Hyakuya into a vampire. Being a Vampire, she is far stronger than a Human and being a Founder among the vampires, she is capable of easily defeating other vampires.\n\nJust like all other vampires (minus Mikaela), she views the humans as nothing more than livestock. She sees them as foul and endlessly greedy creatures who will do anything for their own personal gain. When Ferid Bathory slaughters the Hyakuya Sect orphans she carefully hid in Sanguinem and protected as livestock, she becomes enraged because he fatally wounded one of the seraph and allowed another to escape. She never mentions a word about the orphans and displays no interest in them. She saves Mika's life against his will by turning him into a vampire, but this appears to have been done for her own personal interests. He refuses to drink human blood, so she gives her blood to him in exchange for making him dependent on her. \n\nEven so, she is the only vampire who shows him kindness, and there are several moments when she hugs him or treats him gently. After developing a close bond with Mikaela Hyakuya, she shows concern for his family member, Yuichiro Hyakuya. She claims to like both Mika and Yu. However, it is uncertain if this is because she is close with Mika and is concerned for Mika's sake or if this is because she wants to use the seraph for her own purposes. She also appears to trust Mika, and only she and Mika appear to know Krul's true goals.\n\n(Source: Owari no Seraph Wikia)"},{"mal_id":3,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/3\/Jet_Black","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/253723.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/253723.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/253723t.webp"}},"name":"Jet Black","name_kanji":"\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af","nicknames":["Running Rock","Black Dog"],"favorites":2050,"about":"Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz\/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).\n\nJet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\n\nDuring the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover."},{"mal_id":163084,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/163084\/Wangji_Lan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/364286.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/364286.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/364286t.webp"}},"name":"Wangji Lan","name_kanji":"\u84dd \u5fd8\u673a","nicknames":["Lan Zhan","Hanguang-jun"],"favorites":2049,"about":"Birthday: January 23\n\nLan Wangji is the second young master of the Lan clan.

He now wears the same ring as Sasori, having recovered it after Sasori's death, and took his place as Deidara's partner. Unlike the majority of ninja thus far, Tobi has not been shown wearing a visible forehead protector, so his place of origin is unknown. He wears an orange mask with single eye-hole covered in a swirl pattern concentrated towards the right eye. This odd mask that covers his entire face save for his right eye. Furthermore, Tobi has several bolts or pins present on the arms of his uniform, now obscured by his Akatsuki cloak.\n\nTobi's area of expertise remains unclear, as he has never been shown fighting. He and Deidara have defeated the three-tailed beast, but Tobi is never shown doing anything but running from it. After the battle, which goes largely unwitnessed, Tobi claims to have knocked it out with a single attack. Deidara disagrees with the assessment, claiming that it was his \"artistic contribution\" (exploding clay) that allowed them to win. During his fight with Sasuke, Tobi shows the ability to recover from what are presumably debilitating or fatal blows. After being slashed across the midsection by Sasuke's sword, Tobi collapses, only to stand up again a few seconds later and complain about the speed of the attack. Aside from this, Tobi has yet to demonstrate any techniques.\n\nTobi has a very formal and correct manner of speech. While his physical appearance remains a mystery, Zetsu has implied that he is relatively young when one side of him referred to Tobi as a \"good boy.\" He respects Deidara, referring to him as Deidara-senpai. Tobi's personality is rather odd in comparison with other Akatsuki members. While most of the members are dedicated and serious, though somewhat argumentative or even hostile towards each other when not fighting, Tobi is more carefree and goofy, much like Naruto. His personality does not please Deidara, who believes that all Akatsuki members should be serious and calm. Tobi unintentionally irritates Deidara frequently, which usually results in Deidara attacking Tobi in a comedic fashion."},{"mal_id":135798,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/135798\/Tamaki_Kotatsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/496649.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/496649.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/496649t.webp"}},"name":"Tamaki Kotatsu","name_kanji":"\u74b0 \u53e4\u9054","nicknames":[],"favorites":2033,"about":"Birthday: February 22nd\nAge: 17\nHeight: 156 cm (5' 1\")\nWeight: 47 kg (104 lbs)\n\nTamaki is a former member of the 1st Fire Brigade and currently serves in the 8th Fire Brigade.

Naota idolizes his older brother Tasuku, carrying around Tasuku's baseball bat, and even hanging out with Tasuku's old girlfriend Mamimi. In Naota's mind, Tasuku is the epitome of what it means to be an adult, as opposed to the other adults in his life (e.g. his father, his grandfather, and his teacher) who he perceives as being immature.

In the movie, he pilots 00 Qan[T]~-start-25-stop \nHis name could also be denoted to state his personality. Translated it could mean To obtain the moment.\n\nSetsuna is taciturn, introverted, and righteous against war. He believes there are key disturbances that affect the world from coming together in peace and harmony. He labeled specific people and\/or forces as a source of conflict towards the world's path to peace. He has little tolerance for diplomats and politicians, believing that their negotiations only prolong wars and cause more strife (due to personal experience). He's got a vendetta to settle and his past battle experiences stirs old bitter feelings, increasing his combat potential as a beneficial side effect. Though a self proclaimed atheist, he often questions the motivations of God with people and worldly events. He idolizes the Gundams so much that he wants to embody Exia as himself, a Gundam. He's a traditionalist in honor and a martyr for his cause in Celestial Being. \n\nIn a letter to Marina Ismail, he revealed more in depth into his feelings and thinking. Setsuna wanted to understand the lesser aspects of humanity. He wanted to know why the world is filled with people with innate dark intentions and inconsiderate of other people's suffering. He wanted to find these answers with his Gundam in hopes to bring mutual understanding and peace.\n \nAfter a 5 year hiatus, Setsuna has taken an unofficial role as the leader of the Gundam Meisters. He's now able to assert and express his feelings to people without reservation. Setsuna's ideals are still the same, but his recent experiences lead him to believe the importance of self change and the need to fight for a better future. His determination and strong self confidence motivates and inspires people around him. He's more understanding and compromising, but also capable making hard-but necessary-decisions that would lead people to dislike him. He has no problems making life defining decisions for other people when they can't make the choice and would kill if necessary. \n\nSetsuna is skilled in many ways of war. Trained by Ali Al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, use of explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare by the age of 10. As Celestial Being's Gundam Meister, he uses his former combat training in his KPSA days to reflect Exia's combat style. He's been trained by Celestial Being to know limited MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam. His 5 year hiatus with Celestial Being didn't dull his piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed improvement.\n\n\nSkills &amp; Capabilities\nSetsuna is skilled in many ways of war and fighting.

Due to the power of 00 Gundam's concentrated GN particles with Trans-Am Raiser, Setsuna's brain has been gradually enhanced to utilize quantum brainwaves. He's able to sense quantum brainwaves (QBWs) near him and track users of QBWs. Eventually, he naturally evolves into humanity's first true\/genuine Innovator.\n\nSetsuna's Innovator capabilities aren't completely defined as he's the first naturally evolved Innovator. It has yet to be revealed if he can communicate with Veda or Celestial Being technology like the Innovades can. He can anticipate movements and actions of his opponents and sense impending danger from far distances. As an Innovator, he has heightened reflexes, a longer lifespan than normal humans, and can communicate his thoughts via quantum brainwaves.\n\nAfter Setsuna joined the ELS, his body is not entirely human. The ELS reformed his body based on their bio-technology, forever retaining his youthful appearance with a metallic shine.

His arms can be extended to be 40 meters in length, and each of them has a built-in Incinerator relic. These high-powered beam cannons are capable of reducing to ashes almost anything; however, his Incinerator is a weapon of last resort as even a single shot depletes the body's energy almost completely, which in turn makes Regu lose consciousness for 2 hours ten minutes after its use. Having an artificial body, Regu may be the one of the only intelligent beings completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss. Because of this, he is sometimes referred to as an \"Aubade,\" or, the \"Treasure of the Deep.\"\n\nDespite being a formidable fighter, Regu is rather shy and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress.

Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of \"Father\" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou's attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than \"Father\". Suigintou's desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.\n\nSuigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend finale, she tells Shinku that \"Father\" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.\n\n\n\nAlong with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou's weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle. The variety in Suigintou's abilities, particularly when combined with her savagely cunning nature, makes her a strong player in the Alice Game.\n\nMedium: None (First Season)\/Megu (Second Season)\n\nSuigintou's name in English means, \"Mercury Lamp\"."},{"mal_id":691,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/691\/Sunako_Nakahara","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/46565.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/46565.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/46565t.webp"}},"name":"Sunako Nakahara","name_kanji":"\u4e2d\u539f \u30b9\u30ca\u30b3","nicknames":["Ghost"],"favorites":1949,"about":"Name: Sunako Nakahara\/\u4e2d\u539f \u30b9\u30ca\u30b3\nGender: Female\nAge: Sixteen-Seventeen years\nRace: Human\nHeight: 174 cm (5' 8)\nHair: Black, Long\nEyes: Purple\nOccupation: Student\n\nThe star of the series, Sunako is a Gothic loner who enjoys horror movies.
