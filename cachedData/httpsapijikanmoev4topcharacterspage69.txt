He usually takes responsibility, and tends to avoid violence when possible. He seems to be virtuous, much like his Captain's image; until later, when it was revealed his Captain was a traitor. He is often seen in the company of Renji and Kira. Along with Hinamori, Renji and Kira followed Shuuhei as their senpai during their academy days. Omake chapters also show that he is quite perverted.\n\nShuuhei has several tattoos: a number 69 on his face, a Line across his face and has three lines running vertically down the right side of his face, scars that resulted from an injury in the past when several huge hollows attacked a group of students he was leading into the living world for a lesson in fighting dummy hollows. *NOTE TO MODS: The choker and arm band are not tattoos. They are actually explosive weapons.\n\nVery little is known about Shuuhei's abilities, though it's known that even during his days in the academy he was quite skilled, commonly leading other shinigami trainees on mock missions. However, Izuru Kira mentions that Shuuhei failed the entrance exam for the academy twice. His talent allowed him to become a seated officer in the Gotei 13 without having to pass additional tests. He has never released his Zanpakuto until his battle with Findor Carias one of Barragans Fraccion. When the Arrancar released his Resureccion, Pinsa Guda, Shuuhei released his Zanpakuto. Its name is Kazeshini with the release command \"Reap.\" Its sealed form is a katana with an octangular tsuba.\n\n\nApart from being the vice captain of the 9th division, he has to run the Soul Society's newspaper\/magazine (Seireitei Communication) as he takes over the chief editor position after his Captain, Tosen, betrayed the Soul Society.\n\nShuuhei was taught by Tosen to fear his power, so he doesn't rely much on his Zanpakuto's power. He is a very skilled swordsman, and is also talented at Kido. One of the spells he is always seen to be using is Binding Spell #62 Hyapporankan (\u767e\u6b69\u6b04\u5e72, Hundred Steps Fence). He was first seen using this in the second Bleach movie, The Diamond Dust Rebellion, to try to capture Hitsugaya. In the manga and anime, he also used this spell against Barragan's fraccion, Findor."},{"mal_id":152127,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/152127\/Kaho_Hinata","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/333107.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/333107.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/333107t.webp"}},"name":"Kaho Hinata","name_kanji":"\u65e5\u5411 \u590f\u5e06","nicknames":[],"favorites":796,"about":"Age: 17\nBirthday: August 12\nZodiac: Leo\nHeight: 153 cm (5'0\") (anime) 165 (5'5\") (manga)\nWeight: 44kg \/ 97lbs\nCharacter: Tsundere\n\nKaho is a 17-year-old waitress who fulfills the tsundere trait.
