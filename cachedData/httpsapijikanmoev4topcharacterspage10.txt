Ulquiora is the 4th ranked espada.\n\nUlquiorra is also analytical; during his and Yammy's first visit to the human world, he makes several remarks on the humans who confront them. He theorizes that Orihime Inoue's healing power is a temporal-spatial ability, which Aizen describes as the rejection of fate, and comments on how Ichigo Kurosaki's final release can easily get through Yammy's defenses. He also notes Ichigo's power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own.\n\nIt would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as \"trash,\" which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo's power was so turbulent that eventually he would destroy himself. Grimmjow's conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. Despite Grimmjow's argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra's judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow's unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another.\n\nWhen released his zanpakutou, Murci\u00e9lago (Japanese for \"giant black-winged demon,\" Spanish for \"bat\"), creates two large black wings on his back. His hollow helmet centers atop his head, sporting two large horns, and his arrancar uniform appears more form fitting at the top, becoming robe-like towards the bottom. Additionally, Ulquiorra is apparently unique among the Espada in that he has a second release; Resurrecci\u00f3n Segunda Etapa (Spanish for \"resurrection second stage\"). He becomes more muscular with clawed hands and feet, the whites of his eyes turn black, and his helmet is replaced with elongated horns. He loses his clothes; his arms and legs from the hip down are covered in black fur, and he gains a long thin tail. In both forms he can create long \"lances\" of energy called Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago ,ransa deru reranp\u0101go?, Japanese and Spanish for \"lance of the lightning\"), and when thrown can cause an explosion. Ulquiorra seems unfamiliar with the technique when he uses it in his second release state, unexpectedly missing Ichigo with his first one, however, to compensate, he can produce more should his first miss the target.\n\nTheme song: \"Moonshield,\" on the album \"The Jester Race\" by the group \"In Flames.\"\n\n(Source: Bleach character books I-III)"},{"mal_id":150824,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/150824\/Vladilena_Miliz\u00e9","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/428175.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/428175.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/428175t.webp"}},"name":"Vladilena Miliz\u00e9","name_kanji":"\u30f4\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30fc\u30ca\u30fb\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30bc","nicknames":["Lena","Handler One","Bloody Reina","Bloody Regina","The Bloodstained Queen"],"favorites":8960,"about":"She is more commonly known as Lena by her friends and as Handler One to her subordinates, and is an elite Republican soldier who rose to the rank of Major at the young age of 16.

Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.\n\nKatsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the \"Daybreak of the Joui Faction\" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.\nSince he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura.'\n\nKatsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).\nKatsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.\n\nIn the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him \"Zura.\" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him \"Casserole,\" or \"Cough syrup.\" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura \"Zura.\" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies \"Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!\" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies \"Not Casserole! It's Katsura!\" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since \"Katsura\" can mean wig in Japanese and \"Zura\" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since \"Katsura\" and \"Casserole\" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.\n\nHis name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."},{"mal_id":55743,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/55743\/Tatsuya_Shiba","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/236781.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/236781.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/236781t.webp"}},"name":"Tatsuya Shiba","name_kanji":"\u53f8\u6ce2 \u9054\u4e5f","nicknames":["Mahesvara","Demon of Okinawa","God of Destruction"],"favorites":8610,"about":"Birth: April 24\nHeight: 178 cm\nWeight: 73 kg\nZodiac: Taurus \n\nShiba Tatsuya is a first year student in Course 2 of the First High School.

Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\n\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners\u2019 sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\n\n\nThroughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the \u201conly place I could return to\u201d. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong."},{"mal_id":58,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/58\/Chrollo_Lucilfer","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/182387.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/182387.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/182387t.webp"}},"name":"Chrollo Lucilfer","name_kanji":"\u30af\u30ed\u30ed\uff1d\u30eb\u30b7\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb","nicknames":["Kuroro","Danchou"],"favorites":8577,"about":"Gender: Male\nAge: 26\nHeight: 177 cm\nWeight: 68 kg\nHair color: Black\nEye color: Black (1999), Grey (2011)\nBlood type: AB\nOccupation: Leader of the Phantom Troupe\nNen type: Specialization\n\nChrollo Lucilfer is a calm, handsome young man, coming across as intelligent and charismatic.
