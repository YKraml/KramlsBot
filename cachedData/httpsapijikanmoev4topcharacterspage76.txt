He is from Annaka city, Gunma-ken. He lives in the same apartment complex as Mayama and Morita in room 202. His floormates are Morita and Hasegawa. Takemoto studies architecture, but has little certainty as to what he wishes to do upon graduating; his decision to attend art college was because he liked to build things with his hands, like he had with his father.\n\nTakemoto is one of the more mellow characters in the series. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor and keeps his feelings to himself throughout most of the series. His love for Hagu and his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita causes some internal problems for Takemoto. For example, when Hagu received a bird brooch that was made for her as an anonymous present, Takemoto couldn't bring himself to say that Morita was the one who had made it for her. Instead of acting on his feelings, Takemoto decides to be more of a brother figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed. For example, Takemoto accepts Hagu's requests to build her sophisticated dollhouses and the like. Takemoto is very close to her.\n\nHis relationship with his family also contributes to his mellow mood. His father died when he was still young. Also, his mother works at a hospital as a nurse, so Takemoto would usually spend a lot of his time there, even his Christmas holidays. Furthermore, Takemoto is uncomfortable with his mother's new husband, an outspoken man whose persona seems to a polar opposite to that of his father. However, Takemoto tries to get used to his company and tries to accept the fact that his step-father is capable of looking after his mother, since Takemoto has worried about his mother's well-being ever since he left home. His mother's remarriage and her assurance that he is now free to do as he wishes instead of taking care of her all the time later influenced Takemoto's decision to attend art college.\n\nLater in the series, Takemoto has to stay another year due to getting a stomach ulcer and not being able to complete his graduation thesis."},{"mal_id":97769,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/97769\/Tet","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/274285.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/274285.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/274285t.webp"}},"name":"Tet","name_kanji":"\u30c6\u30c8","nicknames":[],"favorites":698,"about":"Tet (\u30c6\u30c8, Teto) is the One True God and resides in a king chess piece.

She can change her form from human to cat, even halfway, having a human body but with cat ears and tail. One of Himari's ancestors were spared by an Amakawa demon slayer, and so the ancestors and the descendants serve the Amakawa family. Himari has loved Yuuto since his childhood and she often flirts with him. Himari was sad when his parents took Yuuto away without saying goodbye. Himari is afraid of water where her feet does not touch the ground, she is fine with baths and shallow rivers.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":2690,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2690\/Ichigo_Momomiya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/68855.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/68855.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/68855t.webp"}},"name":"Ichigo Momomiya","name_kanji":"\u6843\u5bae\u3044\u3061\u3054","nicknames":["Mew Ichigo","Zoey Hanson"],"favorites":684,"about":"Age: 13-14\nBirthday: March 15 (Pisces)\nHeight: 159 cm\n\nIchigo was just a normal 13-year-old junior high student who was on a date with Aoyama Masaya until her DNA is mysteriously merged with the DNA of an Iriomote Wildcat. Now she is the \"leader\" of a group of girls, whose DNA were also merged with that of an endangered species, called Tokyo Mew Mew. The Mew Mews have to save the world from Chimera Animas, the aliens, and the alien leader, Deep Blue. Originally, Ichigo wants nothing to do with the \"Mew Project\", instead wishing to simply spend time with her crush, Masaya. Later, she grudgingly accepts her fate, realizing what she is (a Mew) and the importance of the task assigned to her.\n\nIchigo has some aspects of the typical magical girl heroine personality: sweet and caring, shy around her love interest, prone to overlooking things the more perceptive and more intelligent can see, and is overactive when she is mad or excited. Ichigo reacts very angrily whenever a loved one is hurt, and dislikes being treated like an object, hence her reaction to Kishu. Ichigo tends to go dreamy and blushes when in the presence of her crush, Masaya, typically head over heels, and she occasionally becomes confused with her feelings, and is prone to act rashly. Many times, she puts her own relationship before saving the world. Overall, she is a friendly person who's willing to give second chances to the people she likes.\n\nShe is injected with the DNA of an Iriomote Wildcat. Later she finds herself acting like, instead of a wildcat, an ordinary housecat and, remembering the dream sequence of a cat jumping into her body when she was injected, realizes something has happened to her.\n\n\nTransformation: Mew Mew Strawberry, Metamorphosis!\nAttack: Ribbon Strawberry Check!
