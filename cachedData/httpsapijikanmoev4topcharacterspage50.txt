When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die.\n\nFei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Y\u016bko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all.\n\nIn order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Y\u016bko the thing most important to her and she pays Y\u016bko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking \"Who are you?\"\n\nAt times, such as in \u014cuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory.

Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn't. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over.\n\nSakura's personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories.

Once she no longer has an immediate use for a man, she'll discard him, a pattern that has led to several of her deaths. She's also jealous when attention is given to other women, and work to break up established couples if presented an opening. Extremely self-centered, she thinks nothing of manipulating others for her pleasure.\n\nLittle is known of Tomie's true background, not even her family name. It is not known how she gained her powers, or even if she was aware of them prior to 1986. According to witnesses, she aged normally to that point, and seemed a standard if very pretty and flirtatious girl. On a field trip to Inariyawa, a small mountain near her school, Tomie was pressuring a teacher she'd been having sex with to leave his wife and marry her, when a male classmate who'd become obsessed with Tomie accosted her. She taunted the boy, and in the ensuing scuffle, Tomie fell over a cliff. Believing Tomie dead, the teacher decided to cover up the accident by chopping up the girl's body with the aid of the boys of the class. It turned out she wasn't quite dead, so this became a particularly gruesome task. The class then scattered the body parts where they would, in theory, not be found.\n\nSome parts were found, identified as Tomie's, and cremated. Her death was blamed on a psychopath, and a funeral was held. Which made it rather a shock when Tomie walked into class the next day as if nothing had happened. Her reappearance drove the more susceptible members of the class to madness, and when two of them tried to go to the police, the others turned violent in an attempt to stop them. Tomie disappeared shortly thereafter.\n\nTomie then began appearing in widely separated locations around Japan, inspiring men to passion and murder. She apparently died several more times, but always turned up alive again. Due to the police's stubborn refusal to credit these stories, no concerted effort was made to capture Tomie at least until 1995.\n\n(Source: herogames.com)"},{"mal_id":144051,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/144051\/Gorou_Akechi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/328865.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/328865.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/328865t.webp"}},"name":"Gorou Akechi","name_kanji":"\u660e\u667a \u543e\u90ce","nicknames":["Crow"],"favorites":1230,"about":"Date of Birth: June 2, 1998\nAge: 17-18\nZodiac: Gemini\nHeight: 178 cm (5'10\")\nWeight: 64 kg (141 lbs)\nBlood Type: AB\nPersona: Robin Hood, Loki, Hereward\nWeapons: Laser Sabers, Serrated Swords, Ray Guns, Silenced Pistols\n\nAkechi is a high school student who conducts a detective business.

During his third life he becomes the twin brother of his descendant Asakura Yoh. His name translates to Leaf King. He is the most powerful shaman in the entirety of the series. His childhood is told in the manga side story Mappa Douji.\n\nDuring his first life, Asakura Hao was constantly surrounded by the horrors of war and thus saw the world as a grim and dark place, until he met the small demon Ohachiyo, who taught him all the positive aspects of life. However, after an accident involving Hao's first Over Soul, Ohachiyo became a permanent part of Hao and cursed him with the very dangerous ability of Reishi. As he grew into an adult Hao became a relatively peaceful man who sought to help the people around him, and thanks to him the Asakura Family prospered. It was because of this gentle and kind nature that he took in the cat Matamune, who wound up becoming what he considered his \"only friend.\"\n\nHowever, his Reishi abilities became too strong and eventually went beyond his control. The negative emotions and thoughts of others were constantly overwhelming him and, since he was unable to turn his Reishi off, the deluge of negativity eventually created a demon inside his own heart. The internal confusion and disorder that was also created eventually led to his desire of creating a Shaman only Kingdom on earth and drove him to become the Shaman King in order to reach this goal.\n\nIn his third and most current incarnation, Hao is usually calm, cruel, and all smiles. The occasions when he is really angry are very rare and when he is angry with someone, that person is usually killed and burned to their soul by The Spirit Of Fire. He also likes to watch Shaman Fights, particularly those that involve strong Shaman, and Asakura Yoh. He is not only interested in that, but also claims that when Yoh reached his limit, he will eat him to become the strongest Shaman.\n\nHe has shown some dislike of being given family titles, as he glared at Yoh in the last chapter when the latter called him \"Nii-chan,\" and his face darkened when his nephew, Asakura Hana, called him Uncle Hao.

Being a weak individual lacking an authoritative presence, he cannot help but let others push him around, a possible metaphoric stereotype on the very proper and manner conscious Japanese society.

She has a pair of dark colored horns on her head, one of which is chipped slightly (however, no one seems to notice or mention them, with the exception of Takano, who calls her a \"monster\"). \n\nIn fact, she has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen and Miotsukushi-hen did she gain the power to interact with others, posing as a distant relative of Rika's and given the name \"Hanyuu Furude.\" Like many of the characters, she can be frightening when angered, and with her spirit-like nature, her appearance can change with her mood until she takes a physical form.\n\nShe is very meek and often makes the noise \"Au au, au au\u2026\" when she is nervous or uncomfortable, or sometimes while trying to make a point. She also tends to end her sentences with nano desu (\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059?, lit. \"it is so\"). \n\nShe dislikes alcohol and kimchi, which Rika imbibes in large amounts as punishment when she finds Hanyuu annoying (as both Hanyuu's and Rika's senses are linked together). She mentions that she is a \"being above humans\" after being sacrificed to atone for the sin of humans, while both Rika and Takano describe her as a kind of deity. \n\nRika refers to her as \"Oyashiro\" when talking with others (evident from Shion's chat with Rika in Meakashi-hen) but does not personally think of her as Oyashiro; instead, she sees her as a close friend. \n\nIn Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, Hanyuu tells Rika that she was sacrificed to atone for the sins of the people of the village, and Hanyuu asked \u014cka Furude (Hanyuu's own daughter and Rika's ancestor) to kill her and then make the village a better place."},{"mal_id":42502,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/42502\/Judar","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/175489.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/175489.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/175489t.webp"}},"name":"Judar","name_kanji":"\u30b8\u30e5\u30c0\u30eb","nicknames":["Magi","Oracle","Black Sun","Priest"],"favorites":1222,"about":"Age: 18-20\nHeight: 173 cm\nWeight: 60 kg\nFamily: father (deceased), mother (deceased)\nAllies: Markkio, Al-Thamen, Gyokuen Ren (former), Hakuei Ren, Kouen Ren, Kouha Ren, Koumei Ren, Kougyoku Ren, Hakuryuu Ren\nEnemies: Sinbad, Ja'far, Masrur, Aladdin, Alibaba Saluja, Ugo\nDjinn: Cassim (former)\nOccupation: Magi, Magician and Oracle\nAffiliation: Kou Empire and Al-Thamen\n\nJudar is one of the four Magi in the current era and a Magician specialized in Ice Magic. He is the Oracle of Al-Thamen and the Kou Empire.\n\nJudar is very powerful, cruel, arrogant and somewhat childish. Usually he doesn't listen to anyone's advice or orders, and does things his own way. He is usually disrespectful, even to his fellow Magi. He seems to be careless about what others think, goading Sinbad into feeling pity for him and then laughing at him. He is a good actor, and goes to great lengths to mock others.\n\nHowever, he also seems to hold deep grudges as he couldn't forgive Al-Thamen or Gyokuen Ren for using his life for their own ends and asked why they couldn't have used Scheherazade or Yunan and why it had to be him.\n\nJudar was chosen by the Rukh and was born in a poor village in the far east plain. Right after Judar was born, his parents, along with everyone else in his village, were immediately killed by Al-Thamen. Judar was taken by the organization, and was taken advantage of before he was able to understand anything. He was taught magic there. He has been in this situation since infancy. Shortly after the founding of the Kou Empire, he was taken there by Al-Thamen and became the empire's Oracle and High Priest.\n\nJudar was trained in Magic ever since infancy by the members of Al-Thamen. Since he specializes in Ice Magic he is a \"Blue Magician\", as ice is a sub-type of Water Magic. Being a Magi, he has an almost limitless supply of Magoi. Nevertheless, without Magic Judal it becomes completely useless, for its physical capacity is very low, having to depend on someone else.\n\nHe is named after the eponymous hero of The Tale of Judar and His Brethren from One Thousand and One Nights.\n\n(Source: Magi Character Encyclopedia, Magi Official Guidebook, Magi Wikia)"},{"mal_id":140507,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/140507\/Joker","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/503405.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/503405.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/503405t.webp"}},"name":"Joker","name_kanji":"\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc","nicknames":[],"favorites":1222,"about":"Age: 28\nHeight: 187 cm\nWeight: 85 kg\n\nJoker is a Third Generation pyrokinetic and a self-proclaimed anti-hero that serves as the Fourth Pillar's guardian.
