She has a carefree and energetic personality, taking delight in simple matters even as she learns about all manner of things in her daily life. In Japanese, Yotsuba's dialogue is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more child-like, and in a typeface that gives the impression of speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, \"She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down.\" However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has an unexplained fear of anything resembling a bullseye.\n\nAt the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, and air conditioners all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as \"Yotsubox\" as a portmanteau of \"Yotsuba's Box\", and often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her. Yotsuba is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer.\n\nThe series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island \"to the left.\" Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims to Fuka Ayase she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old.\n\nYotsuba has never attended school, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is.

She is the first Spirit saved by Shidou and transfers into his class at the end of the first volume. Shidou named her for the date of their first meeting, the 10th. Reine later added the Yatogami surname for her. She is ignorant of the ways of the world, but nevertheless has a normal sense of embarrassment. She seems to have strong feelings for Shidou, which she is shown to be unable to understand when she gets jealous after seeing Shidou accidentally kiss Yoshino.\n\nWhen Tooka first appeared on Earth, unsealed, she was very wary of everyone before Shido finally got the chance to talk to her, because she was constantly being attacked by the AST. However after she was sealed by Shido, she could finally develop, express, and experience life on Earth. Due to the fact that Tooka is new to everything including her emotions, she has a very child-like personality that can make her seem na\u00efve, emotional, energetic, and sometimes gullible due to the fact that she has not been on Earth that long to interact with other people.\n\nHowever, when learning that Yoshino is a Spirit like herself she decides to support Shidou in his cause to save the other Spirits such as Kurumi, even actively participating in battles at times. Due to being a Spirit, she is always being targeted by the AST and is aiming for the kill, because of that she hated humans for always shunning her and thinking that she wasn't allowed to live in this world, but her whole life changed when she met Shidou.\n\nShe was overjoyed that she could live with Shidou now but knowing that Origami was there too she was somehow agitated and is always having a minor quarrel with Origami (mostly because of Shidou and their feelings). Even with that high and cool presence, Tooka lacks some common sense and loves food very much. Despite her lack of knowledge or experience, Tooka does have a normal sense of embarrassment, as shown by her overreacting when seen naked, or caught in otherwise embarrassing situations. At times, Tooka can be surprisingly insightful, as well as perceptive and understanding in regards to other people's feelings, especially when it concerns Shido and her fellow Spirits. She gets also along very well with Kaguya and Yuzuru, especially Kaguya because of their similar energetic personalities. However, Tooka sometimes has problems understanding the two of them, because of the weird way each of them talks.\n\nTooka is a highly offensive combatant who uses a sword as her primary weapon. Aside from this, Tooka also has a lot of \"mana\" within her spirit body which increases both her offensive and defensive abilities. Her primary armament is Sandalphon, which takes on the appearance of a gilded throne which doubles as the scabbard of her broadsword. Her fighting style mostly consists of either physical attacks with \"mana\" encasement on her sword and body, or a high energy attack (like a laser beam) combined with her sword.\n\nThe throne itself seems to be a sort of support machine, based on how she uses it. It can be changed into a transport vessel by laying it horizontally, or to unlock the final form of her weapon, Halvanhelev, by cutting the throne into exact halves. Later in the series, after she got her power sealed by Shido, she can retrieve a bit of her original power if she focuses hard enough or if she becomes emotional."},{"mal_id":195339,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/195339\/Bojji","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/451497.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/451497.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/451497t.webp"}},"name":"Bojji","name_kanji":"\u30dc\u30c3\u30b8","nicknames":[],"favorites":4451,"about":"Bojji is the main protagonist in Ousama Ranking.

All we can do, is accept our own actions. If you still wish to be burdened by your sins, let it show in your future actions. It is your choice how to perceive something that has already happened.\"\n\nKotomine Kirei is the overseer of the Holy Grail War and resides at the church on top of the hill. He is callous and sarcastic, but also quite knowledgeable. As the supervisor of the Grail War, it is his duty to uphold the rules of the Holy Grail War, cover up any incidents that might expose the War to the public, and give sanctuary to any Masters who drop out. Both Tohsaka and Shirou appear to detest him, though in truth they don't seem to dislike him too much. Despite the enmity between the Mage's Association and the Church, Kotomine is a member of both organizations, which is presumably the reason he was chosen to be be the overseer.\n\nKotomine plays an important role in the unfolding events in all three routes, but the route that features him most heavily is the final one, Heaven's Feel where he takes an active role early on.\n\n(Source: TV Tropes)"}]}
