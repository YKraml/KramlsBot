Because of her unstable personality and incredible destructive power, her sister has ordered her not to leave the mansion for nearly 500 years. She really respects her older sister Remilia, but her raw destructive power far exceeds that of her sister's. Although she is usually docile, her insanity makes it difficult for others to understand her.When vampires attack humans, they generally try to take their prey alive in order to suck its blood afterward, but Flandre has always been fed with cooked dishes, and thus doesn't know how to properly attack a human. Whenever she tries to attack a human, she loses control of herself and blows them away without leaving a spot of blood. Her apparent age is about the same as Remilia Scarlet (who looks to be around 10, even though Remilia is 5 years older and they're both about 500 years old). Flandre can destroy anything she wants by moving the \"eye\" of the object, where the tension is highest, into her hand and pouring her power into it. When she clenches her fist whatever she has moved the \"eye\" of into her hand will be destroyed.\n\nShe also has extreme physical strength. Unsurprisingly, all the toys she plays with get broken. Flandre's wings have an unusual appearance which bear almost no resemblance to a vampire's typical bat-like wings (or even organic matter). It has been speculated that her wings are artificial and that she fashioned them herself and then attached them to her body. She may have lost her original wings or been born without them."},{"mal_id":81373,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/81373\/Nyanta","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/224103.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/224103.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/224103t.webp"}},"name":"Nyanta","name_kanji":"\u306b\u3083\u3093\u592a","nicknames":["Adventurer","Chief"],"favorites":520,"about":"Race: Werecat\nClass: Swashbuckler\nSubclass: Chef\n\n\nShiroe has referred to him as Chief since before the Apocalypse.

He is one of The Eleven Supernovas who are all renowned pirates on Sabaody Archipelago whose individual bounties are greater than  100,000,000 when the Straw Hats arrive in the place. He owns second highest revealed bounty that is still active, surpassed by Luffy's bounty of 400,000,000, and the fourth highest number seen so far in the series, after Donquixote Doflamingo, Gekko Moriah and Monkey D. Luffy. The reason his bounty is so high, is because his crew has caused huge numbers of civilian casualties in the course of their activities. \n\nEustass has pale skin, no eyebrows, dark colored lips, and black-painted nails. He has a flame-like red crimson hairstyle and a pair of square-framed goggles that extends with a \"nose\" that covers the ridge of Kid's actual nose. He wears pants with a yellow and black spotted pattern and, what appears to be a pair of sea boots. His appearance seems to be influenced on Heavy Metal musicians. \n\nAround his waist he has a rather large bright blue scarf and belt where he keeps several knives, and what appears to be a gun. He also has gold bracelets around both wrists. \n\nHe wears a furred captain's coat that is adorned with spikes on it's sides. He typically wears this coat with his right arm in it's sleeve and his left arm under the coat itself. \n\nHe also resembles Luffy when it comes with his relationship to his fellow crewmates, as seen when Killer( his first-mate) always talks to him in a casual manner unlike most pirates. \n\nEustass Kid is notorious for causing a huge amount of civilian casualties. He is generally either angry or making sarcastic jokes. When he feels that he's been insulted, he is quick to resort to violence, attacking Scratchmen Apoo apparently for staring at him (in the anime, Apoo also flipped his finger at Kid's direction). \n\nDespite his violent nature, he knows how to restrain himself when in a tight situation. He is also not blind to the way the World Nobles act, remarking that compared to them pirates are almost humane in nature and that they at least have good sides. \n\nKid has the same dream as Luffy, to find One Piece and become the new Pirate King. Because of this, and Luffy's recklessness, he seems to have a great deal of respect for him. However, while they often encounter the same problems, Kid deals with them in his own way, apparently killing everyone who ever laughed at his ambition. He also seems to believe that possessing the determination to achieve the impossible is necessary to survive in the New World. \n\nDuring the timeskip his bounty became 470,000,000."},{"mal_id":148256,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/148256\/Popuko","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/329894.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/329894.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/329894t.webp"}},"name":"Popuko","name_kanji":"\u30dd\u30d7\u5b50","nicknames":[],"favorites":519,"about":"Exceptionally quick to anger."},{"mal_id":1512,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1512\/Holland_Novak","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/89771.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/89771.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/89771t.webp"}},"name":"Holland Novak","name_kanji":"\u30db\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30ce\u30f4\u30a1\u30af","nicknames":[],"favorites":519,"about":"Holland Novak is the leader of Gekkostate, captain of the Gekko and pilot of the LFO Terminus typeR909.

Buu managed to assimilate two of the four Kaioshin, the second being the one who altered his nature to become innocent. Before assimilating the second Kaioshin, he had killed the third Kaioshin.

Like Souma, Takumi's vast experience in the kitchen during his youth has made him one of the best chefs in his family restaurant, Trattoria Aldini in Italy. Similar to Souma's style of cooking, he is considered a culinary genius and resourceful student whom use various ingredients to create a wide variety dishes other than his forte culinary skill. It is also claimed that Souma's ideals and ambition is the sole reason Takumi has such strong tenacity and determination to block Souma's progress to become a top chef, making him one of Souma's arch-rival's in the very academy he enrolled in.\n\nWith the pride of his Italian culinary expertise, Takumi takes his signature cooking style very seriously by making every style he uses as refined as he can. Like Souma, Takumi is very resourceful and able to adapt to use any ingredient to make a refined dish. Like most of the students in the academy, Takumi is prideful of his family restaurant and thinks his cooking style as flawless to anyone. At the same time, Takumi works hard to improvise his skill and to enhance the elegance of the dish, using both his vast knowledge of ingredients and strong will to do such signature dishes without failing his expectations.\n\nDespite his prideful and boastful personality, Takumi is a chef of honor and valor who refuses to use cheating to earn his victory. As an honorable chef, Takumi would prefer a clean match so he can see the true potential of his rival. Takumi is also rather sensitive about losing, particularly to Souma whom he sees his skills as a threat to his life in the academy. He is also has an interiority complex because of the fact that he must succeed no mater what and he can't let anything stand in his way, even if he clearly knows about his fears of losing. Due to that fear, Takumi is constantly honing his skills and has a philosophy that winning is everything, especially when confronted with bitter and strong rivals (such as Souma).\n\nMost of Takumi's styles of cooking are Italian. In certain cases however, Takumi managed to convert his Italian dish into another kind of regional cuisine with his vast knowledge of the food and cooking method, along with his unique style. Due to that advantage, Takumi could replace any of his Italian cuisine ingredients in an alternative way to create any style of cuisine he wishes to create the non-Italian cuisine. Thanks to his past kitchen experience and rigid training under his family restaurant, Takumi mastered almost every cooking tool, such as a Mezzaluna, a two handle cooking knife which is used by the professional Italian chefs, with incredible speed to make the cutting neat as the main art of his cooking method.\n\n(Source: Shokugeki no Souma Wikia)"},{"mal_id":17458,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/17458\/South_Italy","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/113464.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/113464.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/113464t.webp"}},"name":"South Italy","name_kanji":"\u5357\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2, \u30ed\u30f4\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ac\u30b9, \u30ed\u30de\u30fc\u30ce","nicknames":["Romano","Lovino Vargas"],"favorites":514,"about":"Nation's name: Repubblica Italiana (Italian Republic)\nCapital: Rome\nLanguage: Italian\nBirthday: March 17th\nNational flower: Daisy\n\nHuman name: Lovino Vargas\nHeight: Unknown\nAge: 23 (appearance)\n\nSouth Italy, better known as \"Romano,\" is (North) Italy's older brother who represents the southern half of the country. He has dark brown hair which, according to Hidekaz Himaruya, is because he has Arabic blood in him and because he has a somewhat \"dark\" personality. In the anime adaptation and in more recent official artwork, his eyes are brown and he is shown with fair skin. In earlier artwork, his eyes were colored green and he had an olive complexion. Like his brother, he has a curly ahoge which sticks out on the right side of his head (as opposed to Italy's, which sticks out on the left).\n\nDespite many speculations that they are twins, it has been confirmed by Hidekaz Himaruya that Romano is supposed to be older than Italy by a few years. In their childhood, the two knew of each other, but never met until after Grandpa Rome had passed away.  The two were separated again afterwards when Austria had taken Italy to his house and Spain had taken Romano. Eventually, the two were reunited when Italy was unified, but even after unification, they were still on difficult terms, even to this day. Italy adores Romano, while Romano usually brushes him off and tries to ignore him. This is mainly because Romano had always been jealous of his brother. Italy was favored more by Spain than he was, he inherited their grandfather's artistic talent, and Italy, according to Romano, looks more like their grandfather than he does. However, amid all the hard feelings, Romano does care about Italy and wishes that he would admire him more.\n\nFor most of his childhood, he lived with and was raised by Spain, who had controlled South Italy while Austria controlled the North.  Romano worked at Spain's house as a maid, but didn't accomplish much because he usually slacked off, slept, or just plain refused to do anything. If he did manage to find himself actually doing chores, he was quite clumsy when it came to doing so. Because Spain raised him, eventually great similarities between their cultures came to be, such as religion, customs, and even Romano's love for tomatoes. Romano always treated Spain very coldly and acted as though he hated him. Spain was always very affectionate towards him, and although Romano will never admit it, he actually cares for Spain deep down and even gets somewhat jealous when he sees Spain with someone else. Their relationship, to this day, is still quite close.\n\nUnlike his brother, Romano hates Germany with a blazing passion. Several times, he's tried getting revenge on Germany for hanging around Italy and for making him eat German foods. All of these attempts, unfortunately for him, have failed. He seems to possibly hate Germans in general, something that apparently stems back to his childhood. Romano's philosophy about Germans, as revealed in one strip, is that they are all \"uncivilized country bumpkins with bad physiology.\"\n\nIt also appears that Romano dislikes France as well.\n\nHis personality is noted as being \"dark,\" and his outlook of the world is noted as being \"bleak and biased,\" possibly due to the fact that his mafia constantly controls him and leads him around. Romano appears to be tough when compared to Italy, but in reality, he is just as cowardly and weak as he is. He loves pasta and tomatoes, but has a \"no-foreign-food\" policy, especially when it comes to potatoes and cheese. He acts friendly and nice towards women, but is somewhat rude and unsocial towards men. His hobbies include hitting on girls, siestas, cooking, and farming. It is mentioned that he is a skilled pickpocket, despite being quite clumsy and not very good with his hands. He has the nasty habit of speaking vulgarly, most often saying the words \"dammit\" and \"bastard.\" When agitated, he makes the random sound \"chigi,\" much like how his brother says \"veh.\" \n\nAlso to note is that his human first name, \"Lovino,\" means \"the wine\" in Italian, and his human last name, \"Vargas,\" is a common Spanish surname, not Italian."},{"mal_id":29077,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/29077\/Mafuyu_Orifushi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/92679.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/92679.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/92679t.webp"}},"name":"Mafuyu Orifushi","name_kanji":"\u7e54\u7bc0 \u771f\u51ac","nicknames":[],"favorites":513,"about":"Hight: 149 cm\nWeight: 40 kg\nThree Sizes: 78\/45\/80\n\nThe youngest sister in the family.
