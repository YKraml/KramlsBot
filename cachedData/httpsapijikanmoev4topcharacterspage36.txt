She is one of the legendary Sannin.\n\nAfter his failed invasion of Konoha, Orochimaru approaches Tsunade to get her to heal his arms. While she initially refuses, Orochimaru offers to revive Dan and Nawaki in exchange for healing his arms. Intrigued, Tsunade is left a week to consider the matter. Once meeting Uzumaki Naruto, Tsunade begins to remember the dreams of her two loved ones and how much they loved the village of Konoha. While she longs to see them both again, Tsunade ultimately is unable to bring herself to help Orochimaru, his hopes of destroying Konoha too strong to ignore. Determined to protect the village her loved ones held dear until the end of their lives, Tsunade battles with Orochimaru and eventually defeats him. Having accepted the title of Fifth Hokage, Tsunade returns to Konoha afterwards.\n\nSince becoming Hokage, Tsunade has primarily acted as a source of assignments, and mobilizes Konoha's forces when need be. In addition, Tsunade plays a large role in healing the more severe injuries that befall upon those she sends on missions. At the end of Part I, Haruno Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.\n\nTsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her excellent chakra control. By storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders with her bare hands.\n\nShe is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds that most others would consider impossible. As a result of her chakra control and her medical abilities, Tsunade has created a form of regeneration. So she really is near 50 years old, but looks like she were in her twenties."},{"mal_id":1892,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1892\/Pen_Pen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/346982.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/346982.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/346982t.webp"}},"name":"Pen Pen","name_kanji":"\u30da\u30f3\u30da\u30f3","nicknames":[],"favorites":1939,"about":"Age: 5\n\nPen Pen is a hot-spring penguin who lives with Misato Katsuragi as her pet.

I'm not Yoshinon. I'm Yoshino. Yoshinon is my best friend.\"\n\nYoshino is a spirit and an important character in Date A Live series. She is the second Spirit saved by Shido. Yoshino is a shy girl who is said to be the Kindest spirit up to date. Her codename is Hermit.\n\nWhen Yoshino first appeared in the series, it was also when she first encountered Shidou. To Shidou, Yoshino appeared to be a lost child wandering around in the rain. The next time they met, Yoshino fell under attack from the AST and ran away. The third time they met was when Shidou made the decision to save Yoshino from herself and from the AST for he discovered that Yoshino was an extremely kind child even towards the people who were hunting and attacking her.\n\nAfter having most of her power sealed by Shidou, Yoshino started living in one of Ratatoskr's living quarters on Fraxinus temporarily before she moved down to the apartment complex next to Shidou's home. Yoshino is currently practicing with the help from Ratatoskr how to speak for herself, or to be more precise, how to speak without the aid of Yoshinon.\n\nYoshino has the appearance of a young girl, at about 13 to 14 years of age, with blue eyes and hair, wearing a light-blue short dress and outside, wearing a large green raincoat with a pair of rabbit-ear hood, holding a rabbit puppet, Yoshinon, in her left hand. The raincoat seems to have a tail with a pink ribbon attaching to it. Her preferred form of clothing appears to be sundresses along with boots that match her raincoat.\n\nAfter her spirit power was sealed, the dress under her raincoat is the one she is wearing now, adding a hat with a ribbon attach to it and still holding Yoshinon, her puppet. Yoshinon is a mischievous white rabbit puppet that Yoshino always holds in her left hand. Yoshinon's right eye has a black button with a brown band that resembles a eyepatch, while its left eye is a very small pink dot.\n\nAt her first appearance, Yoshino is a very shy girl, unable to articulate full sentences and express herself well. Other than Yoshino, she has her other personality named Yoshinon which is the rabbit in her left arm. Yoshino says it's her hero for protecting her from bad guys (which are the ASTs). It is also said that Yoshino created Yoshinon in order to restrain herself from hurting humans. As she lets Yoshinon do the talking for her with its outgoing personality. She improves after Shidou seals her powers and begins learning to integrate herself into society. Later in the story, most of the time Yoshino will force herself to speak personally while conversing with Shidou, instead of using her puppet Yoshinon.\n\nYoshino has the ability to manipulate all states of water (solid, liquid, and gas) in her surrounding area. She usually uses her powers for defensive purposes only due to her kind and shy nature.\n\nHer Angel, Zadkiel, is a huge puppet that resembles Yoshinon. Zadkiel has two forms, the first form resembles Yoshinon but is a lot bigger, with one red round eye and an eyepatch, large sharp teeth, and white skin. In this form, Zadkiel has the ability to absorb water from the ground and air and release it in the form of an attack. Yoshinon is also able to talk through the puppet, and acts as a limiter to suppress the Angel's powers so that it doesn't end up killing anyone. Zadkiel's second form appears to be its true form, this form also resembles Yoshinon but is even larger than when Yoshinon becomes Zadkiel. The second form is larger than a many-story building, and does not have an eyepatch. This Zadkiel has the same powers as the other but is a lot more powerful. Even Yoshino has problems controlling the Angel.\n\nWhen using Sirion, Yoshino fuses with Zadkiel, gaining an ice armour over her Astral Dress. Her powers over water and ice increased to the point of the surrounding area being frozen. Shido remarked that she looked like she was wearing Zadkiel.\n\nBeing a passive Spirit, Yoshino prefers to take non-aggressive actions such as running and hiding as opposed to engaging in combat against her enemies. Yoshino's Astral Dress is named El, and has enough defensive power to block an AST missile barrage.\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wiki)"},{"mal_id":48967,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/48967\/Cadis_Etrama_Di_Raizel","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/249417.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/249417.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/249417t.webp"}},"name":"Cadis Etrama Di Raizel","name_kanji":"\uce74\ub514\uc2a4 \uc5d0\ud2b8\ub77c\ub9c8 \ub514 \ub77c\uc774\uc81c\ub974 \/ \u30ab\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30fb\u30a8\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30fb\u30c7\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb","nicknames":["Rai"],"favorites":1910,"about":"Age: 3000+\nRace: Noble\nOccupation: The Noblesse, Student\nEye colour: Red\nHair colour: Black\n\nRai is a very elegant and mysterious Noble.
