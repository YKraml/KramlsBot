With this information, some fans believed that Julius may have been a peasant himself.\n\nAfter successfully passing the Magic Knights exam, Julius joined the Grey Deer squad. Currently known as the Aqua Deer to fans of the show, Julius's squad possessed a number of notable characters. At some point, the Wizard King was chosen to lead the squad.\n\nAs Captain, Julius recruited Yami Sukehiro, current captain of the Black Bulls. Despite Yami being a foreigner who was ostracized by the kingdom, Julus recognized his potential. The two grew close and their friendship is a highlight of the show. Surprising to some viewers, Julius Novachrono didn't always want to become Wizard King. As a Royal Knight, he was happy in his role as it allowed him to satisfy his obsession with magic and meet powerful mages in the process.\n\nAs expected from the giant nerd, Julius possesses an incredible amount of magical knowledge, far surpassing that of the Magic Knights Captains. After Yuno gains a new power during the investigation of a dungeon, Julius immediately recognizes this as the wind spirit Sylph, despite the fact that Yuno knew very little about the power himself or how to even control it.\n\nAdditionally, the Wizard King managed to decipher an ancient magical item designed by the very first Wizard King over 500 years ago. But even Julius has his limits, such as when he was surprised by Asta's anti-magic sword.\n\nDon't let his happy-go-lucky attitude deceive you, Julius can be ruthless when required. Throughout the anime, the Wizard King demonstrates kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. Even when fighting Patolli, Julius preferred to capture him alive in order to save William's body.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that he is soft. When the Eye of The Midnight Sun attacked the kingdom and captured Asta, in the blink of an eye Julius killed two members of the terrorist organization. The man is willing to take a life in order to save those he cares about.\n\n(Source: CBR)"},{"mal_id":166026,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/166026\/Nero","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/366777.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/366777.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/366777t.webp"}},"name":"Nero","name_kanji":"\u9ed2\u30cd\u30ed","nicknames":[],"favorites":1628,"about":"Nero is an Anti-bird who decided to stay alongside Asta after encountering him at the beginning of the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.\n\n\n\n(Source: Black Clover Wiki)"},{"mal_id":157643,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/157643\/Kokichi_Ouma","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/347717.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/347717.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/347717t.webp"}},"name":"Kokichi Ouma","name_kanji":"\u738b\u99ac \u5c0f\u5409","nicknames":[],"favorites":1623,"about":"Birthday: June 21\nLikes: carbonated drinks, telling lies\nDislikes: pig feet\n\nA student who claims to be the \"Supreme Leader of a secret society of over 10,000 members.\" Because he's an evil supreme leader, he will unabashedly tell lies and he is also an elusive person who admits to being a liar, says whatever he's thinking, and will shed crocodile tears.

Kenichi was frequently treated as a friendless loser at the beginning of the series, however it all changed when he met Furinji Miu. After the fateful meeting, he decided to stand for himself and be truly strong; or at least, strong enough to protect those who are dear to him. Though he's constantly considered cowardly at the beginning of the series, he shows that when his loved ones lives are on the line, he's actually much braver than he appears.\n\n\n\nOn his way to school one day Kenichi met Miu once again (though he did not recognize her) and the two soon became friends. Kenichi was a member of the school's karate club but was forced to do menial chores and was used as a punching bag until one day he stood up to a hulking student who tried to force him to quit and the two agreed to a match in which the loser will be forced to quit the club. With Miu's help he managed to win but quit the club anyway and drew unwanted attention from the club's president whom he fought twice managing an easy win the second time due to training he received at the Ryozanpaku dojo. However the trouble does not end for Kenichi as the club president had ties to a rising delinquent group known as Ragnarok who begin to take an interest in Kenichi. The manga follows Kenichi as he continues to train at, and eventually live at the Ryozanpaku dojo as well as facing increasingly more powerful foes.\n\nThough it is consistently stated that Kenichi has no talent for martial arts he more than makes up for it with his work ethic. It is due to this and the abnormally intense training regime he is forced to endure that Kenichi has gone from being considered the weakest student in his high school to being able to fight and defeat opponents with many years worth of skill as well as some with borderline superhuman abilities.\n\nKenichi is kind, compassionate, thoughtful, and moral to a fault. He is against violence and only studies martial arts to protect others, and also adheres to a strict code of morals and refuses to kill or hit women even if it means death. In spite of his strong moral standards however Kenichi can be quite perverted as he will jump at the chance to see Miu or Shigure bathing and also buys pictures of them from Ma (though these pictures are mostly fakes). He also adopted a \"fighting style\" from Ma called \"ecchi mode\" in which he attempts to grope women which strangely enough has actually helped him get out of a jam before. As a result of his kindness Kenichi has made many friends some of whom are former enemies and has even managed to unknowingly win the affections of Ma Renka and Li Raichi.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":2765,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2765\/Alpha_Hatsuseno","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/303591.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/303591.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/303591t.webp"}},"name":"Alpha Hatsuseno","name_kanji":"\u521d\u702c\u91ce\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1","nicknames":[],"favorites":1601,"about":"Alpha is the main character of the series.

Her pleasant disposition has won her several friends and loyal customers yet she is also capable of making deep insights and displays an unusual level of maturity during her more private moments.

They travelled along with Priest Heiter and Warrior Eisen in a ten years long journey to defeat the Demon King. She was the last member to be recruited to the party and, despite Heiter\u2019s initial impression of her mana being average, Himmel had a hunch she was the most powerful mage he had ever met.\n\nBeing an elf that has lived for over a thousand years, Frieren has a hard time forming meaningful relationships with humans because of the difference in their lifespans and how they perceive the passage of time. This generally manifests itself as laziness, since missing an important event is of no importance as she will have plenty of opportunities to relive it in the future, or as a nearly sociopathic inability to comprehend human\u2019s feelings. For instance, she tends to not notice how her lack of impatience or cold statements can affect humans around her. Her party members have also frequently stated that they can\u2019t comprehend her feelings or read what goes on in her head.\n\nDespite being an extremely powerful mage, Frieren has the habit of collecting rare and daily usage centered magic, like magic that can polish a bronze statue or make flowers bloom. She always asks for a grimoire as a reward even if she already knows its contents or \u2014 when it comes to The Great Mage Flamme\u2019s lost grimoires \u2014 know they are fakes.\n\nAfter the deaths of Hero Himmel and Priest Heiter, Frieren decided she wants to learn more about humans. She is currently travelling with Fern \u2014 her pupil who was a war refugee left in her care by Priest Heiter \u2014 in a quest to Ende, the place where souls reside in the northernmost tip of the continent and where the Demon King\u2019s Castle was built to try and speak to Himmel\u2019s soul. In her new journey, Frieren visits many places her old party travelled through in the past and relives memories, slowly understanding more about their meaning and her feelings.\n\nIronically, Fern is generally the one to take care of Frieren in daily activities despite being far younger.\n\n\n\n(Source: Frieren Fandom Wiki)\n\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.
