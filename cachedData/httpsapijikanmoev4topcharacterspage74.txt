She poses as a teacher and a nurse at Shibusen so she has access to all the students files. While in disguise, she acts like a very supportive person to hide her true nature. She stays at Shibusen to study the students to see which ones can become kishin (demon gods). Medusa is willing to use anyone and everyone to further her plans by any means necessary (even as far as planting snake bombs in her fellow witches bodies so they would cooperate with her). She can use them without dropping her soul protection, which allows her to not be discovered by others. Her personality is similar to Dr. Stein as she sees everyone and everything as an experiment. Her animal theme is snakes due to her magic, clothes, and that she constantly chants \"Nake snake cobra cobubra.\" She has thousands of snakes in her body ready to do her bidding. She engaged in an intense battle with Dr. Stein in the lowest level of the school to allow the awakening of the first kishin. While she initially had the upper hand, her momentary pleasure at Asura's successful resurrection allowed Stein to slice her in half. Making one final attack and claiming to love him, he skewered her through the skull and her body evaporated. However, a snake decorated with Medusa's arrow markings was seen escaping the city through a drainpipe on the outskirts, most likely her transformed.

The twins have opposing beliefs; while Hanako stresses the importance of maintaining a peaceful balance between humans and supernaturals, Tsukasa believes that the two should behave how they desire, even if it means wrecking tremendous havoc. While Hanako grants wishes to the living, Tsukasa grants wishes to the dead. He wears a black short-sleeved kimono with a grey hakama and a white button up underneath. Opposite to Hanako, he has a black seal on his right cheek and uses black koku-joudai willow wisps. Tsukasa works with his assistant, Sakura, to change the rumors of supernaturals in the school for his own purposes.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":161283,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/161283\/Kazuya_Kinoshita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/396701.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/396701.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/396701t.webp"}},"name":"Kazuya Kinoshita","name_kanji":"\u6728\u30ce\u4e0b \u548c\u4e5f","nicknames":[],"favorites":718,"about":"Kazuya Kinoshita is a twenty-year-old plain college student.
