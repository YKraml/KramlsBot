He often helps Amu even though he works for Easter. Ikuto actually despises Easter and tries to wrench himself free from them by trying to find the Embryo to grant his own wish. He possesses the Dumpty Key which pairs with Amu's Humpty Lock which at first did not fit in the keyhole. Like his father, Ikuto is a skilled violinist.\n\nHis Shugo Chara is Yoru.\n\nAnon Black\u2019s Profile of Ikuto:\n\nIkuto is tall, wears dark clothing, and has dark blue hair.

His Chara-Change gives him cat ears and a tail, and causes him to behave much like a cat. His Chara-Nari is Black Lynx.\n\nIkuto plays the violin, and is the son of a famous violinist. His father married his mother, who was the heir to Easter. The company ordered that he drop everything, including his violin, for Easter. His father refused and disappeared, leaving Ikuto\u2019s mother in such distress that she was admitted to a hospital. Ikuto came to live with Tadase\u2019s family, but was treated harshly by Tadase\u2019s mother, who was jealous of her husband\u2019s relationship with Ikuto\u2019s mother. Eventually, Ikuto ran away from home, going to Tsukasa\u2019s home for an unspecified amount of time, and returning a few years before the current time to Tadase\u2019s house. There he was found by Tadase\u2019s dog, Betty, who was dead, and Tadase\u2019s grandmother, who had collapsed. Ikuto was cursed out once again, but not until he\u2019d stolen away Tadase\u2019s Dumpty Key, which Tadase\u2019s father had given to his son when Ikuto\u2019s father left.\n\nBecause of this, Tadase and Ikuto have a very strained relationship, if any.\n\nIkuto\u2019s personality as a child was quiet, shy, and protective of his friends \u2013 when he accepts the blame for breaking the vase, even when he knew he\u2019d be chastised for it. This part of his personality stays through his adolescence \u2013 he is more than willing to sacrifice himself for the ones he holds dear, even if it means a few nights alone on the street, being captured by Easter, or playing the villain and making himself hated. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Ikuto cares very much about Amu, and probably has a crush on her, especially in the way he acts with her in chapters 28-30. He seems to only show his true colors, and talk about himself, when he\u2019s in her presence. Of course, this is the way Peach-Pit has presented it to us.\n\nIkuto acts aloof, cold, flirtatious, and mysterious. He appears at will, and is openly defiant of his superiors in Easter. It\u2019s obvious he doesn\u2019t like working there, and has his own reasons for wanting the Embryo that have yet to be revealed. He takes joy in teasing and flirting with Amu, especially in her reactions. \n\nIn Shugo Chara! Doki, he stays at Easter to protect Utau.

He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians.\n\nPiccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku's child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.\n\nPiccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.\n\nPiccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He's also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion\nand is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in Fukkatsu no F. He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende's current occupation).\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Guide, Character Edition)"},{"mal_id":93273,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/93273\/Hestia","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/285883.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/285883.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/285883t.webp"}},"name":"Hestia","name_kanji":"\u30d8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2","nicknames":[],"favorites":3765,"about":"Hestia is a beautiful petite woman whose appearance can be considered to be between a little girl and a female teen. She has roundish blue eyes and black hair going down to her hips tied in a twin tail fashion with a white ribbon on each tail.

She is frequently barefoot, but does occasionally wear a pair of white flip-flops.\n\nHestia is an energetic, kind goddess who sees potential in Bell. She is a hard worker, and works jobs to support the two while Bell goes off to the dungeon. Hestia tends to be shown as very petty and gets jealous easily when girls, namely Aizu, show interest in Bell, because she is deeply in love with him, or they are the reason for his strength growth. Hestia is shown to have a lewd side, as she often sneaks into Bell's bed and sleeps with him, even getting overjoyed about it. Despite seeming mature and dependable toward Bell, Hestia is in truth, a lazy goddess, as she couldn't get a job or put effort into work until her friends kicked her out and shown to be a glutton, always eating food from others as she couldn't pay for meals.\n\nAfter descending to the Lower World, Hestia was taken care of by her friend, Hephaestus but was soon asked to live on her own and gave her a room at an abandoned church.\n\nHestia tried to create her own familia but wasn't able recruit even a single person. After failing to recruit for the 50th time, she noticed Bell Cranel and decided to secretly follow him. Hestia noticed that Bell was trying to enter a familia but was rejected multiple times and is in the same boat as her. Hestia then took the chance to recruit him which Bell happily agreed upon; becoming the first member of her familia. She took Bell to a bookstore, the location she already decided beforehand, and granted \"God's Grace\" to her first dependent.\n\n(Source: DanMachi Wiki)"},{"mal_id":139244,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/139244\/Yuuri_Katsuki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/322595.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/322595.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/322595t.webp"}},"name":"Yuuri Katsuki","name_kanji":"\u52dd\u751f \u52c7\u5229","nicknames":[],"favorites":3758,"about":"Age: 23\nBirthday: November 29\nZodiac Sign: Sagittarius\nBlood Type: A\nHeight: 173 cm\n\nA figure skater who is faint-hearted and gains weight easily.

Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\n\nAs a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji has a Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.\n\nBecause his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \n\nAfter the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan."},{"mal_id":208,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/208\/Yuki_Souma","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417954.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417954.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417954t.webp"}},"name":"Yuki Souma","name_kanji":"\u8349\u6469 \u7531\u5e0c","nicknames":["Prince Yuki","Yunyun","Yun-chan"],"favorites":3724,"about":"Age: 16-17\nHeight: 170.5 cm\nWeight: 54 kg\nBlood Type: A\nAnimal: Rat\n\nYuki is the rat of the zodiac.
