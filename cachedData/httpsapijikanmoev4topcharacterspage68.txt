Itsuki has confirmed to Kyon once that his outer personality is merely an artificial image he fakes in accordance to Haruhi's impression of him, and hints that his true character is something quite different, being \"less pleasing\" in the eyes of others. Maintaining his casual, constantly smiling self, however, is vital for keeping Haruhi's mentality balanced.\n\nOut of the three Brigade members, Kyon is the least fond of Itsuki. He often finds himself annoyed with Itsuki's plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to Haruhi's outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories (e.g., omphalos hypothesis, Anthropic principle, etc.). He is also distrustful of Itsuki's intentions, comparing him to Yuki Nagato when it comes to deciphering his expressions. Itsuki's fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the SOS Brigade, its members and related events.

Contrary to Musashi, Kojirou is known to occasionally show morals, integrity and compassion and is shown to be quite kind to his Pok\u00e9mon. Kojirou has also appeared to be more tactical in battles than his teammate Musashi.\n\nKojirou has a beloved bottle cap collection and had extremely wealthy parents, who are portrayed in the English dub as Southern aristocrats (despite this, he has no Southern accent). He lived a very spoiled and sheltered life, knowing very little about the world outside his home, but also suffered heavy restrictions and rules. He grew up disliking carnivals due to being driven past them unable to attend, and was left distraught when he was unable to get a Chimecho (a Pokemon he calls his \"first love\") as a result. \n\nHe finally ran away from home after his parents tried to marry him off to a girl named Rumiko, ironically almost identical in appearance to Musashi. His dislike of the many upper-class rules led him to believe that living a life struggling on the streets was better than a life where everything was given, which eventually led him to joining Team Rocket.\n\nAlthough the team often appears in disguise, a common source of fan humor is Kojirou's habit of cross dressing or wearing women's clothes (to contrast with Musashi), makeup, and a history with violent, domineering women. It was this that led to the initial banning (the episode has aired after being severely edited) of the episode \"Beauty and the Beach,\" that had Kojirou wearing fake breasts in order to win a bikini competition. In the original Japanese, Kojiro's effeminate tendencies are played up as a contrast to his smooth, baritone voice; while the English dub originally took this tack, Kojirou's voice has become progressively high-pitched and clownish as time has gone on.\n\nThe episode \"Holy Matrimony\" in which Kojirou returns home has a scene in which he goes to a cellar, only to be met by Rumiko dressed as a dominatrix, much to Kojirou's terror. The cellar is equipped as a full S&amp;M dungeon which Meowth refers to as \"weird gym equipment\" in the dub.\n\nThe episode \"That's Just Swellow\" revealed that, at some point during his childhood, he was trained to be a Pokeringer champion by a former master, and is still extremely competent at it (reaching the final round in that episode before losing to Satoshi). He also has won a Pokemon Orienteering competition with his Mime Jr.\n\nKojirou carries a rose wherever he goes, and is occasionally shown holding it when Team Rocket recites the motto, but usually only when they are introduced to somebody new."},{"mal_id":2321,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2321\/Vincent_Valentine","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/46857.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/46857.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/46857t.webp"}},"name":"Vincent Valentine","name_kanji":"\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3","nicknames":[],"favorites":821,"about":"Vincent was once a member of the Turks thirty years before the events of Final Fantasy VII.

He is extremely tall and appears to be much older than he actually is. Chad has a tattoo on his left shoulder which reads Amore e Morte (\"love and death\" in Italian) and consists of a heart, a snake and angel wings around the heart. In the series, he is usually seen wearing either his school uniform or a t-shirt. At one point in the series, he is seen wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt with a rose emblazoned on the left sleeve. The rose may be in honor of his grandfather seeing as how his grandfather's name was Oscar Joaqu\u00edn de la Rosa, de la Rosa being Spanish for \"of the Rose.\"\n\nChad is a quiet person and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.\n\nChad likes music, but rarely watches TV. The only programs he likes are Carnivore Kingdom, which starts at 8 a.m. on Sundays. He likes it so much that he bought the DVDs for it. Not surprisingly, since Kon is a cheap knock-off plushie of the main character of Carnivore Kingdom, Chad finds Kon especially cute. The other show is Don Kan'onji's Ghost Bust. Chad also has a bass guitar, but has never been shown playing it. It has been shown in Chad's room in episode 69 and in the 8th anime ending sequence. It's also shown in episode 12 after a \"band practice.\" He is also seen carrying it immediately preceding the appearance of the incomplete arrancar.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":174745,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/174745\/Beam","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/467960.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/467960.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/467960t.webp"}},"name":"Beam","name_kanji":"\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0","nicknames":["Shark Fiend"],"favorites":819,"about":"Beam is a Shark Fiend and Public Safety Devil Hunter from Special Division 4."},{"mal_id":5059,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/5059\/Serpico","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/150923.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/150923.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/150923t.webp"}},"name":"Serpico","name_kanji":"\u30bb\u30eb\u30d4\u30b3","nicknames":[],"favorites":818,"about":"Serpico is Farnese's companion and unbeknownst to her, her paternal half-brother.

It is essential that every person who applies for a fighter position submits one personally, but since Yogi himself hadn't thought about it until the application period came, he left it to his superior Hirato, who with a gentle, smiling face submitted some outrageous things.

He is also referred to as the \"Key of Destiny\". Roxas's original self is Sora. He is voiced by Jesse McCartney in the English version of Kingdom Hearts II and Koki Uchiyama in the Japanese version. When pre-release Kingdom Hearts II screenshots and video showed this character without an Organization coat, he was featured prominently, emphasizing his importance to the future game's plot. In battle, he uses the \"Oathkeeper\" and \"Oblivion\" Keyblades, which represent Sora's memories of Kairi and Riku, as well as the power of light. As a stronger Nobody, Roxas controls Samurai Nobodies. Roxas's backstory and his joining of Organization XIII itself will be explored in the upcoming Kingdom Hearts 358\/2 Days, for the Nintendo DS. Roxas will be a playable character in the game.\n\nUnlike the other Organization members, Roxas lacks memories of his previous life, due to the short time Sora had spent as a Heartless. During Roxas's time in the Organization, he and Axel became friends, but Roxas leaves to find answers as to why he possesses the Keyblade. He is confronted by Riku, who defeats Roxas and takes him to DiZ. In Kingdom Hearts II, DiZ places Roxas in a virtual Twilight Town, leaving him without any memory of the Organization and with a fabricated identity to throw them off. While here Roxas begins seeing his other self's memories in dreams. Roxas lives an otherwise normal life in \"Twilight Town\" until Axel infiltrates it to save him. Despite Axel's attempts to stop him and Roxas gaining back his memories of the Organization, Roxas merges with Sora early in the game, which also causes some of Roxas's memories to influence Sora.\n\nRoxas appears twice more later in the game. The first is a battle with Sora, shown only as a cut scene and never fully explained. In Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Sora's battle with Roxas is made playable, and a cut scene is added that shows Xemnas explaining that Axel's death triggered the reappearance of Roxas. Roxas appears once again with Namin\u00e9 before Kairi enters the corridor of darkness back to Destiny Islands. He and Namin\u00e9 imply that they will live on within Sora and Kairi as both a part of them and as individuals, as seen in the ending cinematic when they smile at each other through Sora and Kairi.
