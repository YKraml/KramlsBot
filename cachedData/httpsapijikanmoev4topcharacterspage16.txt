(776 U.C.)\n\nCount Reinhard von Lohengramm is a young admiral in the Galactic Empire.\n\nHe was born Reinhard von M\u00fcsel to an impoverished aristocratic family. His mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. His father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young Reinhard was his beloved older sister Annerose. When Reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. There he met Siegfried Kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness Reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived. \n\nThe emperor Friedrich IV took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. Afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, Annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. Infuriated Reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the Goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. He swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again. \n\nTo achieve his goals and with Kircheis by his side, Reinhard joined the military. He quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the \"count of Lohengramm\". As he steps into the admiralty, the Emperor gives him the prototype battleship Br\u00fcnhild, which serves as Reinhards flagship from then on.\n\nNicknamed \"Blonde Brat\" by his enemies and \"Golden Lion\" by his friends, Reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. Brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. Ambitious and determined, Reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart."},{"mal_id":81929,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/81929\/Tatsumaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/296110.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/296110.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/296110t.webp"}},"name":"Tatsumaki","name_kanji":"\u6226\u6144\u306e\u30bf\u30c4\u30de\u30ad","nicknames":["Terrible Tornado"],"favorites":5388,"about":"Race: Human (Esper)\nAge: 28\nAbilities: Psychokinesis\nOccupation: Superhero\nLevel: S-Class; Rank: 2\nAffiliation: Hero Association\nRelatives: Fubuki (Younger sister)\n\nTatsumaki is the S-Class, Rank 2 superhero and the older sister of Fubuki.\n\nTatsumaki is a petite woman, commonly mistaken for being much younger than she really is.

He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available \"civil\" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect.

According to the living legend, \"Doujima Gin,\" her tongue was so special that she can taste 8 different salts blindfolded. Due to her reputation, she is both inspired and feared by many newcomers within the academy (except Souma), even the academy lecturers and her \"senpai\" found her narcissistic ego was so overwhelming that she is too stubborn to listens to almost anyone. Other than that, Erina is also picky about food to which she rather picks high-class cuisine instead of daily dishes, and claimed that normal food doesn't match her taste.

It is also claimed that she can cook as fast as Souma, which made her one of the proficient rivals to Souma's style even though she rarely cooks (she is prideful of her skills though)."},{"mal_id":2819,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2819\/Takumi_Fujiwara","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/296425.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/296425.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/296425t.webp"}},"name":"Takumi Fujiwara","name_kanji":"\u85e4\u539f \u62d3\u6d77","nicknames":["Tak"],"favorites":5330,"about":"Age: 18, 19 (Project D)\nCar: High tech two-tone Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86)\nLikes: green seasons, rear end of his AE86, naps\nDislikes: showoffs, losing, girls that flirt\n\nTakumi Fujiwara is the son of Bunta Fujiwara, the owner of a tofu shop in his hometown Akina. He rarely shows emotion. His best friend is Itsuki Takeuchi, who is a racing fan.\n\nTakumi works part-time at a gas station with Itsuki, along with Iketani, who is a member of the local racing team, the Akina Speed Stars. In the first few episodes both Itsuki and Iketani think that Takumi has no driving ability because of Takumi's total disinterest in cars and racing.\n\nThe only one who suspects that Takumi has an advanced driving technique is the owner of the gas station, Yuuichi, as seen in the episode where Takumi discusses drifting technique with Iketani and Itsuki. In fact, Takumi has far more experience on the touge than Iketani and Itsuki, as Takumi has been driving his father's AE86 Trueno for five years (since he was 13 in his first year of junior high school, 7th grade), delivering tofu to a hotel at 4 a.m. every day. Takumi has been manipulated subtly by Bunta into developing driving skills, without being fully aware of Bunta's intent.\n\nBunta aside, Takumi's driving technique is the best on Akina; the very fact that he has managed to win races against far more powerful cars with his AE86 Trueno is testament to his driving skills. As a result of constant everyday practice and over 5 years of experience on Akina, Takumi is able to adapt to nearly any situation that presents itself during a race with astonishing speed. One factor in his nearly unparalleled driving skills is his ability to visualize the road in his head, thus making up for the lack of visibility no matter how dark the mountain pass may be. He is an instinctive rather than an intellectual driver. Although the mizutoshi technique is a great but difficult technique that his father taught him, it lead him to many victories through out the story.\n\n\nTakumi looks docile and weak minded, but he is stubborn and strong-willed, many remarks are said about that. Yuuichi figure out he was like his father in his behavior. However, to those who have raced against him, Takumi possesses tremendous concentration and instinctive insight once behind the wheel (and these qualities are most evident when he is chasing after his opponent). His apparent docility became traps for many opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":122365,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/122365\/Rui_Tachibana","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/382489.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/382489.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/382489t.webp"}},"name":"Rui Tachibana","name_kanji":"\u6a58 \u7460\u8863","nicknames":["Rui-Rui"],"favorites":5308,"about":"Birthday: September 5th\nBlood Type: A\nHeight: 155cm\nHobbies: Reading, watching documentaries\nStrengths: Cooking, skiing, ice skating, kendama\nWeaknesses: Thunder and lightning, anything horror-related, prank TV shows, slugs\nFavorite Foods: Pasta, omurice, Natsuo's yaki udon, tiramisu\nFavorite Music: Miyuki Nakajima, Tatsuro Yamashita, Masashi Sada, Flower Companyz, Nagisa Kurok\nFavorite Books: The works of Miyuki Miyabe, Natsuhiko Kyogoku, Kanae Minato, Keigo Higashino, and Otaro Maijo\nOriginally blunt, stubbornly introverted, and unempathetic beyond her immediate family, Rui develops through her teenage years thanks to a loveless one-night stand, a new step-family, and a close set of newfound friends in the literary society, and her first experiences of love.
