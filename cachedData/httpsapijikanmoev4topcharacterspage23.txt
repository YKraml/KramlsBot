She is a gothic female angel, with long violet\/pink hair and teal eyes. Stocking is the younger of the Anarchy sisters. Like Panty, her name derives from the object she is able to weaponize. \n\nShe is a level-headed and intelligent girl, though, she can be rude if provoked, especially towards her older sister, Panty. Stocking enjoys eating various desserts and sugary food, but doesn't seem to gain weight (she assures all the fat goes towards her breasts anyway). However, she becomes enraged and sensitive whenever someone calls her fat.\n\nStocking is often considered to be the personification of the deadly sin, Gluttony, due to her obsession with sweets. She does not share Panty's obsession with sex, even though she does display some masochistic tendencies, such as bondage, vore and electrocution, which is ironic considering she constantly insults the demon sisters and Corset affinity for similar fetishes by calling them 'BDSM loving freaks'. Stocking does claim she has very special standards in men, and prefers love over lust. She strings men along (not wanting them to believe she is 'easy'), and would never cheat on someone she truly loves. However, she has been shown to have a very strange and twisted vision of what she finds attractive. \n\nStocking hates spicy food, just as much as Panty hates sweet food. Stocking is sometimes overshadowed by Panty when in larger audiences due to the latter's more sensuous and exhibitionist behavior, such as in \"Sex and the Daten City\" and \"1 Angry Ghost.\" She is almost always seen carrying around a plush cat, Honekoneko, whose expressions often match Stocking's mood.\n\nAbilities\nTo prepare for battle, Stocking removes her stockings. Her ability is being able to transform her stockings into a pair of katanas, known as Stripes I &amp; II, which can be attached at the base of the hilt. It's safe to assume she can form other blades as well, considering the range of weaponry at Panty's disposal."},{"mal_id":23,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/23\/Kyouya_Ootori","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/90675.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/90675.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/90675t.webp"}},"name":"Kyouya Ootori","name_kanji":"\u9cf3 \u93e1\u591c","nicknames":["Mommy","Shadow Prince","Low Blood Pressure Demon Lord"],"favorites":3402,"about":"Age: 17\nBirthday: November 22\nHeight: 180 cm (5' 11\")\nBlood Type: AB\nHost Type: \"Cool\"\nZodiac Sign: Sagittarius \nFavorite Subjects: English, German, Physics\nFavorite Foods: Anything spicy, nothing sweet\nRose Color: violet\n\nKyouya Ootori, a second-year student at Ouran Gakuen, is the sly and calculating vice-president of the Host Club founded by his best friend and polar opposite, Tamaki Suoh.

She is a truant high school student with pyromaniacal tendencies; she also smokes a lot and spends most of her time under a bridge. She is often seen with a camera, and was once seen smoking worn cigarette with \"Never Knows Best\" written onto the paper.\n\nShe has the peculiar tendency to name people and things \"Ta-kun (Or sometimes simply spelled as Takkun),\" after her personal nickname for Naota's brother (and Naota himself). The \"-kun\" suffix is an informal and intimate honorific primarily used when addressing males of equal or junior status. Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as \"Ta-kun\" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. (Naota is well-aware of the similarity between his nickname and his brother's name.) Mamimi also calls Tasuku \"Tasuku-sempai\" since he is an older classmate.\n\nThe story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota's classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain and her peers to bully her. In fact, Mamimi can be exceedingly destructive\u2014although only when nobody is watching. She spends much of FLCLimax exacting retribution against those who have wronged her\u2014only to have her plan backfire.\n\nMamimi can be seen to lack control over her life or willpower, hence the near-constant smoking and child-like reliance on others, whether it'd be Naota or his older brother Tasuku. This could also explain why she loves taking care of things that are weak-willed, which she leaves (or which escape, like Ta-kun, the black kitten) when they start to show independence. This leads to her eventual disinterest in Naota and ultimately proves a disaster for her when her last adoptee, the terminal core from a robot, goes haywire and overpowers first her and then the military.\n\nAs far as high schoolers go, she seems to be rather sexually frustrated, as she often pursues an uncomfortable level of intimacy with Naota (most likely because she sees him as his brother's replacement), which annoys Naota greatly. When he asks why she constantly clings to him, she responds \"If I don't, I'll overflow.\"\n\nMost characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota's friends refer to her as \"Naota's Wife\" and Haruko calls her \"Sameji,\" a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as \"that high school girl.\""},{"mal_id":46305,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/46305\/Kuroyukihime","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/185407.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/185407.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/185407t.webp"}},"name":"Kuroyukihime","name_kanji":"\u9ed2\u96ea\u59eb","nicknames":["Black Snow Princess","Snow Black","Black King","Black Lotus","Hime","Sacchan"],"favorites":3382,"about":"Age: 14-15 years old\nBirthday: September 30, 2032\nBlood Type: A\nHair Color: Black \nEye Color: Orange\nClass: Year 2-3 Middle School\nHeight: 159 cm (5'3\")\nWeight: 48 kg\nOccupation: Black King\nLegion: Nega Nebulus (Leader)\nSchool: Umesato Junior High School\nAvatar: Black Lotus\nLevel: 9\nType: Darkness Element\nAbilities:\n\nEquipment: Terminate Swords, Mystical Reins, Neuro Linker\nFavourite Quote: No need to be afraid of the end, because this world is infinite.\n\nThe main female protagonist and leader of the Nega Nebulus legion, her real name is unknown.

He wears a short, brown fur cloak and a light blue shirt and pants with fur boots. A rope dangled from his hand and neck as The Nameless Boy died holding Joaan's leash, though the latter soon disappeared. The injury that took The Boy's life is also present on Fushi's left leg.

He was also Death Scythe\u2019s first partner (Maka's mother was the second). He was also the most powerful technician to ever graduate from the school, Shibusen. He has a bolt going through his head which turns so his thoughts would be on the matter at hand. He mostly moves by pushing his chair in the direction he wants to go even if it ends up with him crashed on the floor. Stein is such a strong fighter that he could take down Black Star while still seated in his chair. Stein sees everything in the world, including himself, as an experiment or specimen. He even experimented on Spirit (now Death Scythe) when he was sleeping during the five years they worked together. His understanding of soul wavelengths gives him a huge advantage against other users since he can change his own to match the other\u2019s wavelength and thereby nullify or disrupt the soul frequency of the technician and weapon. This comes from his high spiritual flexibility and by observing his opponent beforehand. His soul wavelength is so high that he doesn\u2019t need a weapon and can channel it through his body and release it out of his body as electric discharge. He has a strange hobby of wanting to dissect anything he thinks is interesting. He is also the school doctor; he still respects Spirit and still calls him Senpai.\n\nOther than his electric charges, he uses a repertoire of other techniques such as Soul Sutures, a technique which binds people to e.g. the ground via a soul wavelength (the technique is costly, it requires so much attention the wielder cannot move), Witch Hunter (the technique Maka uses) when he is using Spirit as a weapon, and the ability to cancel out direct soul attacks by matching wavelengths (explained earlier)."}]}
