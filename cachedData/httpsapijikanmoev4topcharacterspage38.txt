As a consequence for losing, Senji's right eye was removed for research. He returns a short time later during Ganta's next match, sporting an eyepatch and gives Ganta assistance with figuring out his opponent's techniques. He also helps Ganta understand his own capabilities. His change in personality toward Ganta is due to his respect for Ganta's strength. Senji comments that because Ganta beat him, he is not allowed to lose until they have a rematch.\n\nHe seems to thoroughly enjoy violence, and his favorite phrase is \"Dead Center.\" Despite his wild and battle-hungry attitude, he does have a sense of honor and respects strength and determination.

There are also incarnations of him in the Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, the Pocket Monsters Zensho manga, and the Ash &amp; Pikachu manga. He is loosely based on the male protagonist of the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue. The family name \"Ketchum\" is a pun of the anime's former tagline and slogan \"Gotta catch 'em all!\"\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Ash was 10 years old, and later, in the episode \"The Battle Of The Badge,\" Ash said that it was a whole year since he and Pikachu had visited Viridian City, making him 11. Furthermore, in the short called \"Pikachu &amp; Pichu\" which was attached to Pok\u00e9mon 3: The Movie, he said the day when the events depicted in the short took place was the day he met Pikachu, meaning his age at that time would be at least 12. However, two seasons later, the official Japanese Pok\u00e9mon website reported that Ash was the same age as May, who was 10 years old at the time. This and the fact that the two are at the same height suggests that none of the characters have aged since the show began, placing the Pokemon anime in a floating timeline.\n\nAsh is a caring and valiant trainer but he can be confident to the point of arrogance and is known for being stubborn at times. He also has quite the reckless streak, which has led him to troublesome situations and even near death. But when in a Pok\u00e9mon battle, he is highly competitive, and he shows tremendous presence of mind, taking advantage of the battlefield as well the nature of his and the enemy Pok\u00e9mon's moves to claim victory after victory, though he has been known to lose from time to time.\n\nAsh has matured greatly over the course of the series, and has considerably improved his abilities as a trainer, but his earnestness and determination remain the same. During the first season of the series, Ash trained to catch more Pok\u00e9mon than his childhood rival, Gary Oak, although Gary has caught more. He soon begins to focus more on each of his Pok\u00e9mon's abilities. He also impresses many trainers by winning battles in which his Pok\u00e9mon has a type disadvantage. At the Johto League Silver Conference Ash finally won a battle against Gary.\n\nThroughout the anime, Ash has met a number of rivals, including Richie, whom he faced in the Indigo League, and Casey, a diehard Electabuzz fanatic. During Pok\u00e9mon tournaments, Ash has made rivals out of Harrison, Jackson, Morrison, and Tyson (the last of which went on to become the champion of the Hoenn Pok\u00e9mon league). Near the beginning of Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond &amp; Pearl, Ash meets an arrogant young trainer named Paul, who quickly becomes his new rival.\n\nAsh's primary nemesis is a group of comical antagonists named Team Rocket. Ever since the second episode, \"Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!\" two Team Rocket operatives named Jessie and James, along with a talking Meowth, have always tried to steal his first Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu but have always failed. There are some occasions when they work together like the Pok\u00e9mon: The Movie 2000.\n\nAsh's mother is Delia Ketchum (Hanako in Japan). She is a caring and thoughtful woman, though occasionally oblivious as her son, and in the English version of the anime often pesters him to change his boxer shorts every day, a gag throughout the early episodes of the first few series.\n\nThe identity of his father has remained unknown. One reference to him exists in the anime. During a phone conversation between Ash and his mother in the second episode, she states to her amazement that he got from Pallet Town to Viridian City in one day. \"It took your father four days to get there when he started Pok\u00e9mon training,\" she says, \"He'll be so proud!\" A line from the play, Pok\u00e9mon Live!, suggests that Delia, at one time, had a relationship with the leader of Team Rocket, Giovanni when she was a teenager, but in the anime, no evidence of Giovanni being Ash's father has been shown currently.\n\nIn the episode \"Showdown at Dark City,\" Ash went by the name of Tom Ato (tomato) after spotting some ketchup that Pikachu was eating. He had to disguise his name, so that his real name would not get a bad reputation, since he was dealing with the rivaling Yas and Kas gyms."},{"mal_id":8298,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/8298\/Kaonashi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/64987.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/64987.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/64987t.webp"}},"name":"Kaonashi","name_kanji":"\u30ab\u30aa\u30ca\u30b7","nicknames":["No Face"],"favorites":1764,"about":"No Face is an odd spirit that takes an interest in Chihiro.

Shinpachi is the captain of the \"Otsu's Imperial Guard,\" a pop-singer's fan club.\n\nShinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.\n\nDespite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakid\u014d-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.\n\nIn the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.\n\nHis name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."},{"mal_id":35476,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/35476\/Kuranosuke_Koibuchi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/103186.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/103186.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/103186t.webp"}},"name":"Kuranosuke Koibuchi","name_kanji":"\u9bc9\u6df5 \u8535\u4e4b\u4ecb","nicknames":["Kurako","Kura-pyon","Niku"],"favorites":1750,"about":"Kuranosuke is the son of a rich political family.
