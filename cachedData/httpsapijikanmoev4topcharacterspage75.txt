Gene was thrown into an escape pod by his father moments before their ship exploded and landed on Sentinel III where he would remain until the beginning of the series. Until Hilda questions him, \"Are you going to keep running away?\" and Gene responds, \"Keep running away?\" Gene is scared of space\u2014but Hilda's questioning of his courage is the turning point, and Gene's fear of space disappears.\n\nWhile on Sentinel III, Gene met the much younger Jim Hawking and the two went into business; forming a company called Starwind and Hawking Enterprises. Gene is a reckless ladies' man and a bit of a pervert who shamelessly flirts with almost every woman he meets. He would rather try to achieve his goals with a minimum of effort and his reckless attitude proves a continuous source of frustration to Jim. Despite his brash nature, Gene does have a caring side to his personality which he usually displays toward Melfina. After realizing Melfina had no recollection of her past or function, Gene promises to help her find her past and protects her from the various individuals in pursuit of her. Also, throughout the course of the series, he begins to develop feelings for her, and grows rather irritated with Harry on behalf of his apparent relationship with Melfina."},{"mal_id":149982,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/149982\/Azusa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/437612.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/437612.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/437612t.webp"}},"name":"Azusa","name_kanji":"\u30a2\u30ba\u30b5 \/ \u76f8\u6ca2 \u6893","nicknames":["Aizawa Azusa"],"favorites":716,"about":"The protagonist.

Thus during the Boshin War, Shishio was rendered unconscious by several gunshots, doused in oil and burned alive by the new government formed by the Ishin Shishi. He survived, sustaining severe damage to his entire body. Afterwards, he assembled a group of the best fighters in Japan, called the Juppongatana (Ten Swords), to overthrow the Meiji government.\n\nShishio envisioned a Japan ruled by him, enforcing the principles of natural selection, or what he called \"the strong eat the weak\". Using this belief he ran a campaign against the Meiji government, as he felt it was too weak to effectively lead the country. Using his motto, he molded an ideological disciple out of Seta S\u014djir\u014d, who served as his right-hand man, and the strongest of the Juppongatana.

She has no spirit powers like Yusuke's Rei Gun or Kuwabara's Spirit Sword, but she possesses heightened spirit awareness and spiritual energy (as can be determined by her ability to use the detective tools, which require spirit energy in order to work.) Typically, when Botan fights, she tends to favor blunt instruments like her oar, a metal bat, or, if all else fails, her fists. In her human form, Botan can use any of Yusuke's detective items. In one scene during the episode \"Setting the Trap,\" Botan was planning to use the Concentration Ring to blow up walls, which suggests she might have spirit powers like Yusuke, but they are undisclosed.

Presumably the longest serving captain after Kyouraku and Ukitake, Unohana has a presence that tends make everyone around her feel at ease. However, her anger is just as potent as even members of 11th squad become paralyzed with fear whenever they're careless enough to invoke her wrath. In omake chapters and scenes, it is shown that Unohana has a curiosity about convenience stores in the world of the living, and also likes picking racy swimsuits for Isane when she visits the living world."},{"mal_id":3862,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/3862\/Tsukune_Aono","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/134613.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/134613.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/134613t.webp"}},"name":"Tsukune Aono","name_kanji":"\u9752\u91ce \u6708\u97f3","nicknames":["Tsukki"],"favorites":702,"about":"Race: Human (former) \u2192 Hagure Ayashi \u2192 Shins\u014d Vampire\/Modified-Human\/Vampiric Ghoul (actual)\nAge: 15-16 (beginning) - 17 (currently)\nBirthday: June 22\nStarsign: Cancer\nGender: Male\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 58 kg\nKnown Relatives:\n\u25cf Aono, K\u014dji (father)\n\u25cf Aono, Kasumi (mother)\n\u25cf Aono, Ky\u014dko (cousin)\nEquipment\/Weapon: Holy Lock\nAbilities:\n\u25cf Martial Arts\n\u25cf Y\u014djutsu\n\u25cf T\u014dh\u014d F\u016bhai Style\nTechniques:\n\u25cf Bakury\u016bjin\n\u25cf Muei-T\u014d\n\u25cf Muei-T\u014d Yamikiri\n\n\nManga version:\n\nThe male protagonist, he is an average, ordinary human boy who is somehow accepted into a school of monsters and despite the danger it entails for him, he remains on campus, with one of his motivations for staying being Moka Akashiya, the vampiric, female protagonist of the series.\n\nTsukune Aono is a young man who has failed all of his high school entrance exams. With no options left for him, his parents sends him to Y\u014dkai Academy. Upon arriving there however, he soon discovers that it is a special school for monsters and demons alike, and any human who discovers its existience will be killed. Fearing for his life, he later meets Moka Akashiya, a beautiful girl who turns out to be a vampire. Soon after he becomes friends with her, he soon learns from her that she hates humans. After revealing his secret to Moka to the latter's shock, he then decides to return to the human world, but relents at the last minute when he comes to rescue her from a bullying student, stating that he really likes her and wants to become her friend. Soon after the misunderstanding was cleared, he decides to stay at Yokai Academy regardless of the impending danger that awaits him.\n\nThough considerate and polite, Tsukune is a gentle person even though there have been many instances, where he has been put into dangerous, life-threatening situations (many of which are due to enemies whom he later befriends), he has never held a grudge against anyone. Tsukune's selflessness and courage comes to the foreground, whenever he or someone from his group of friends is faced with the possibility of injury, or even death. Though powerless, he has the tendency of throwing himself into danger to ensure the safety of his friends. As the series progresses, this habit becomes extremely dangerous the enemies he encounters are so powerful that he frequently comes close to dying. Ironically, this leads to a situation where he calls upon \"his own\" supernatural abilities (originally from Inner Moka) as well as the concealment of his human identity from much of the student body.\n\nHe become a Hagure (Outcast) Ayashi because the injected one more time with Moka's blood; and he become (later in the series) the first Modified-Human by T\u014dh\u014d F\u016bhai because he needed to have his body augmented to better suit the flow of Y\u014dkai and to learn the Y\u014djutsu (Y\u014dkai Techniques). Before his body was in constant pain and it was said that if he is injected with Moka's blood one more time, he would most likely die.\n\n\nTsukune after the Modified-Human treatment he suffers heterochromia, his right eye is blue and his left eye is purple."},{"mal_id":170611,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/170611\/Ushio_Kofune","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/431802.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/431802.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/431802t.webp"}},"name":"Ushio Kofune","name_kanji":"\u5c0f\u821f \u6f6e","nicknames":[],"favorites":700,"about":"Ushio is the deuteragonist of the series.
