He frees himself from the straitjacket and receives the case containing the bomb-collars, delivered by Courier, which he seems to have been expecting.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nThe Cutthroat is a sadistic murderer who enjoys the sight of blood spurting out of his kills. In contrast, his usual behavior is innocent, like a child's. He becomes unable to control his murderous impulses under certain conditions. He gets overly excited when he sees red. Cutthroat acts very child-like and friendly in idle situations, often singing children's rhymes or frolicking around care-freely. He can also be extremely serious when something of interest to him is being threatened, namely when Swindler is about to be hurt, and would go to any lengths to prevent it from happening. \n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Cutthroat is a tall, pale man with white neck-length hair and purple eyes. He dons a completely white attire composed of a long dress shirt underneath a knee-length overcoat and trousers that reach just over his boots, revealing black tights. The Cutthroat's left hand is covered up with bandages, and he has a mole below his left eye. \n\n\nAbilities\n\nHe is skilled with sharp objects and appears to show great value to his knives. In serious moments, putting his childish behavior aside, Cutthroat has very sharp senses and reflexes, he is able to throw daggers accurately at targets and quickly react to attacks. Cutthroat has shown to have immense skill in using slight of hand, having been shown to hide several of his daggers, knives and blades within his sleeves and coat and has shown to be able to immediately grab them by sliding them into his hand in mid combat. Cutthroat has also displayed immense physical strength, having been able to be strong enough to pierce human bodies through and through barehanded and showed that his kicks and fists where strong enough to break skulls. For some unknown reason, Cutthroat does not seem to bear or mind any pain as long as blood and Swindler is involved. It could be that he has a high tolerance of pain. \n\n\n(Source: Akudama Drive Wiki)"},{"mal_id":43670,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/43670\/Banri_Tada","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/228533.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/228533.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/228533t.webp"}},"name":"Banri Tada","name_kanji":"\u591a\u7530 \u4e07\u91cc","nicknames":[],"favorites":598,"about":"Having had a nearly fatal accident shortly after high school graduation, he lost all memories from before then.

She has a very noble and elegant aura, lives in a large mansion with many maids, and is considered to be of the highest standing at their school; she has a considerable fan following of both genders and is the frequent target of love confessions. She is a member of the prestigious kyudo (Japanese archery) club and frequently uses the bow as her weapon of preference during confrontations with the Orochi. Chikane is also exceptionally skilled in the areas of tennis and, more significantly, the piano; she apparently enjoys playing for Himeko, who enjoys listening to her perform.

Such grade-skipping would be unthinkable in Japan, and the series humorously explores its potential consequences. The other characters find Chiyo amazingly cute, but sometimes take advantage of both her youthfulness and her scholastic abilities. Her diminutive stature leads to her having a lack of confidence, particularly in sports where she fears she is a burden to others. Chiyo is frequently viewed with jealousy by fellow students, initially because of her intelligence, but later also because of the discovery that her family is exceedingly wealthy (they own an enormous mansion and a summer house which Chiyo invites her classmates to visit on several occasions). The stylistic rendering of Chiyo's pigtails allow for several visual gags in both the manga and anime: Osaka often imagines them to be flapping wings, or as entities independent of Chiyo herself. At home, she can almost always be found in the company of her enormous dog, Tadakichi-san. Of all of the girls, she is the only one who does not sit through college \"entrance exams\" as she intends to study overseas, possibly in America."}]}
