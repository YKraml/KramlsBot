However, this does not mean that she is to be taken lightly; Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. The only time at which she has ever revealed her true strength is during the Lord of Terror arc. At the end of this arc, Belldandy completely reconstructed their home from rubble, mentioning that doing so only took one ten-millionth of her power.\n\nBelldandy's capacities and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, \"see\" people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and \"speak\" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she's a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage\u2014although given her personality, \"rampage\" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself.\n\nBelldandy's angel is Holy Bell (Bless\u9920Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus.\n\nBelldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil. Rather, she works at the Goddess Relief Agency which deals with granting wishes (forming contracts) with humans, similar to Peorth's work at the Earth Assistance Agency."},{"mal_id":198675,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/198675\/Destiny","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/466240.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/466240.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/466240t.webp"}},"name":"Destiny","name_kanji":"\u904b\u547d","nicknames":["Cosette"],"favorites":1394,"about":"Destiny is a Musicart named after L.V.

She is very close to her brother, who she calls \"An-Chan\", and behaves in a jealous and clingy way whenever she feels that he is not giving her the attention she deserves, to the point where it is obvious that she has a brother complex. She sees Maria as a rival for Kodaka's brotherly affections, so she often gets into fights with her.\n\nShe has a penchant for darkness, vampires and the macabre ever since she started watching an anime called Full Metal Necromancer. As a result she often speaks in an affected fashion, and claims to be known as \"Reisys VI Felicity Sumeragi\", an ancient vampire who has lived for ten thousand years, but this fa\u00e7ade quickly breaks down when she gets emotionally worked up and she speaks in a strong Ky\u016bsh\u016b accent. Indeed, her behavior does not for the most part differ from that of a regular girl (procrastinating with her homework, staying inside when it is hot, etc.) which Kodaka points out, causing her to be embarrassed and slightly lose character. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":24734,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/24734\/Yukio_Okumura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/114364.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/114364.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/114364t.webp"}},"name":"Yukio Okumura","name_kanji":"\u5965\u6751 \u96ea\u7537","nicknames":["Yuki-chan","Scaredy Four-Eyes"],"favorites":1384,"about":"Age: 15\nBirthday: December 27\nHair: Black (Manga) Brown (Anime)\nEyes: Teal\nHeight: 180 cm (5' 11\")\nWeight: 70 kg (154 lbs)\nBlood: Type O\nPastimes and talents: Formulating plans and reading Jump Square every month\nAverage hours of sleep per night: 4\nFavorite foods: Seafood (especially sashimi)\nFavorite manga genres: Comedy, horror, suspense\nFavorite type of girl: ...\n\nYukio is Rin's younger, fraternal twin brother.
