People see him as a rare find that will someday take over the Guild. He is very playful and fearless, and treats many things like they were games. His odd nature can be seen in his awe of Claus Valca's skills and giving him the nickname \"Immelmann\" (referring to the World War I German ace, Max Immelmann and the maneuver Claus frequently used while flying, the Immelmann turn). This strange nature is mostly due to the Guild lifestyle and fear of his sister Delphine. His first appearance in the series is marked by a chess-match with his beloved friend Lucciola and with the Guild's power and surveillance, watches the skies of a skirmish between Guild ships searching for Alvis Hamilton and the Silvana. He finds extraordinary talent in Claus's vanship piloting, and after the Horizon Cave Eight vanship race, he starts to have strong interactions with the main characters. He later joins them on the Silvana in order to escape his sister, but is forced back to the Guild before long, and is brainwashed by a Guild device in preparation for the \"Rite of the Covenant\". Driven to insanity, he participates in the Rite of the Covenant, where the next Maestro is chosen, and emerges victorious. He escapes with Claus and Alvis soon after and is nursed back to health in the Mad-Thane residence. He flees from there in a vanship and travels to the Grand Stream. Being delirious, his memory resets to the moment of the race in Horizon Cave, and he attempts to pass Claus. At that moment he tells his navi, Lucciola (who isn't there), to jump out so they can get more speed. He crosses a flock of rainbirds believing them to be the finish line and congratulates Lucciola on their victory and invites him to celebrate, but he then turns around to find he is not there. Believing Lucciola had actually jumped from the vanship, he attempts to cross to his seat while crying, but his vanship is then hit by a gust of wind and he is swallowed by the Grand Stream. Despite this, his voice is heard during a later scene in the Silvana's engine room cheering \"Ascending!\"\n\n\nIn \"Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing\", Dio is a skilled vanship pilot taking refuge among the Sky Pirates. He is free spirited and likes to stick his nose into any situation if he can make it interesting. Little is known about his background before he joined the Sky Pirates six months prior to the story. His signature aerial maneuver is the Immelmann turn.\n\n(Source: (Source: Wikipedia, Official website)"},{"mal_id":2753,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2753\/Smoker","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/235841.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/235841.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/235841t.webp"}},"name":"Smoker","name_kanji":"\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc","nicknames":["White Hunter"],"favorites":512,"about":"Age: 34, 36\nBirthday: March 14\nAffliation: The Marines\nTitle:Captain, later Commodore, currently Vice Admiral\nDevil Fruit: Moku Moku no Mi (Plume-Plume, Smoke-Smoke Fruit)\n\nSmoker the White Hunter is a Marine.

He describes himself as average: he has average grades, lives in an average family (upper-middle class with a father, mother and sister), and has average physical features. Currently, he attends an average high school with Manami (later, Kuroneko as well); he begins the story as a first-year, but he becomes a second-year during the events of the novel. As far as future plans, he intends to attend the same local university as his childhood friend, Manami.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Kyousuke and his younger sister, Kirino, have a distant relationship. Kyousuke says that they entered a \"cold war\" of sorts a few years ago, but the details of this cold war have yet to be revealed. After years of coldness between the two, things suddenly change when Kyousuke finds one of Kirino's adult games and learns that she is an otaku. Through this, he tries to be a supportive older brother while realizing that he knows very little about his sister (for example, Kyousuke was oblivious to the fact that she was a model, a track star, and one of the top five students of the prefecture). Kyousuke feels somewhat belittled by Kirino's accomplishments, but he learns to take pride in her.\n\nAfter discovering Kirino's secret hobbies, Kyousuke provides Kirino with \"life counseling\" at her request. During this \"life counseling,\" Kirino forces Kyousuke to play eroge. Kyousuke now considers himself to be a bit of an otaku and often refers to situations and people using otaku terms (e.g., flag events, tsundere, yandere). Trying to be a good brother, Kyousuke offers to accompany Kirino to her offline meet-up. This introduced him to Saori and Kuroneko; both of them have become his friends. Additionally, Kyousuke is friends with Manami, one of his childhood friends. Some of Kyousuke's classmates assume that Kyousuke and Manami are going out, but Kyousuke denies this. When Akagi asked Kyousuke if he would be okay if someone started dating Manami, Kyousuke said that he would be uncomfortable with the situation.\n\nKyousuke is a good-hearted character and is extremely loyal to his friends and Kirino. He's willing to take risks for them and help them at any cost. When Kuroneko started attending the same high school as Kyousuke, she was without any friends; however, Kyousuke joined the computer research club with her, despite being ignorant about anything concerning computers, in order for her to meet new friends. He has shown the same amount of concern for other friends as well as his sister on several occasions."},{"mal_id":87719,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/87719\/Kazuki_Hoshino","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/280825.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/280825.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/280825t.webp"}},"name":"Kazuki Hoshino","name_kanji":"\u661f\u91ce \u4e00\u8f1d","nicknames":["Kazu","Hoshii"],"favorites":508,"about":"A completely ordinary high school student who loves idle chatter with his friends and Umaibous, a Japanese snack.

He can dodge traps, pick locks, sneak past security, and break into almost any location; however, he prefers to create art, not steal it."},{"mal_id":5804,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/5804\/Utau_Hoshina","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/66327.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/66327.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/66327t.webp"}},"name":"Utau Hoshina","name_kanji":"\u307b\u3057\u306a \u6b4c\u5504","nicknames":["Utau Tsukiyomi","Lunatic Charm","Dark Jewel","Seraphic Charm"],"favorites":505,"about":"Age: 14-16\nBirthday: November 9\nBlood type: A\nHeight: 161cm\nWeight: 42kg\n\nUtau is a 14-year-old junior high\/high school student model turned into singing idol."},{"mal_id":10752,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/10752\/Byakuran","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/90548.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/90548.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/90548t.webp"}},"name":"Byakuran","name_kanji":"\u767d\u862d","nicknames":[],"favorites":504,"about":"Name: Byakuran\nGender: male\nBirthday: October 28\nAge: early-to-mid 20s\nFlame element: Sky\nAffiliation: Gesso Family, Millefiore Family\n\nByakuran is the former head of Gesso Famiglia and one of the two current bosses of Millefiore Famiglia, the other being Uni.

In the series, she is referred to as \"Ninamori,\" her last name. She is the daughter of the mayor of Mabase and is class president. Ninamori has N.O. powers as well: Naota's third robot, which appears at first as \"cat ears\" transfers to her instantly in the 3rd episode, while the two of them are fighting, as the Medical Factory's siren blows. She projects a proper, even slightly stuck-up personality, and conceals personal information to an almost obsessive degree; she does not even let her classmates know that she needs corrective lenses, instead wearing contacts while at school. Even with her class president status, however, Eri isn't above breaking the rules to get what she wants. She rigs the voting during the casting for the school play in order to get the lead role and have Naota cast opposite her, which (along with letting him see her wearing glasses) hints at her crush on Naota. Other hints are her expressed dislike of Mamimi and a final scene with Naota by a vending machine that mirrors Mamimi and Naota's early-series interactions. Ninamori is highly intelligent, if a little jaded. Much like Naota, Ninamori attempts to act mature, and although her parents' problems trouble her deeply, she refuses to admit it until near the end of the series."},{"mal_id":5830,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/5830\/Machi_Komachine","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/182389.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/182389.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/182389t.webp"}},"name":"Machi Komachine","name_kanji":"\u30de\u30c1\uff1d\u30b3\u30de\u30c1\u30cd","nicknames":[],"favorites":504,"about":"Age: 24\nHeight: 159 cm\nWeight: 48 kg\n\nNot known to show much emotion, Machi seems to be one of the most cold members of the Genei Ryodan.
